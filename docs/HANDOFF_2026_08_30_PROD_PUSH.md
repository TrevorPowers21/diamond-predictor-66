Two different pitch populations → the same numbers. That is **independent replication**, not a self-check.

**PROD PREREQS ALSO DONE:** 3 × `team_season_stats` migrations (dependency order) · `pitch_log_corrected` view rebuilt
94→102 cols · backups `_v2_prechain_backup` (2,576,146) · `_hm_prestep5_backup` (30,025) · `_pm_prestep5_backup` (29,238).
**Classifier:** `src/savant/lib/stuffPlusClassifierV2.ts` @ **95.2% / 95.3%**.

## ▶️ NEXT ACTIONS, IN ORDER (prod)
1. ~~**C24** `backfill_trackman_pitches_pitching_master.ts`~~ ✅ **DONE 2026-08-30** — patched to be PITCH_LOG-FIRST for
   D1 with a JUCO legacy fallback (the legacy source undercounted by ~12.1 pitches/pitcher and agreed with pitch_log
   for only 11.9% of pitchers). Applied 5,618 rows. Gate: D1 5,375/5,375 · NJCAA_D1 2,695/2,695 · D2 1/1.
2. ~~**C27 `computeNcaaAverages`**~~ ✅ **DONE 2026-08-30** — 72 fields, 40 model_config rows;
   `p_ncaa_avg_stuff_plus` 101.8341 → **100.0141** (confirms the recenter survived the whole chain).
3. ~~**C26** `computeAndStoreScores` (propagate=false)~~ ✅ **DONE 2026-08-30** — pitchers 8,071 / hitters 8,244,
   0 errors, `player_predictions` untouched. Added the missing double-keyed `--prod` guard to
   `_run_store_no_propagate.ts` first (its banner had claimed "staging" while writing prod).
4. ~~**C29 NJCAA_D1 re-tag**~~ ✅ **DONE 2026-08-30** — 10 rows re-tagged; prod now `D1 30 · NJCAA_D1 10 · D2 2`,
   0 NJCAA rows remain tagged D1 (matches staging). C28 is now safe to run.
5. **C28 conference stats — READY, 4 steps (runbook listed 3).** ✅ prepped: `--prod` guards added to BOTH producers
   (refuse paths verified) · `_confstats_backup` (162) + `_parkfactors_backup` (615) created on prod · **G-GATE PASSED**
   (77 cols, 0 changed, worst 0.000000 — bucketA is idempotent) · Conference Stuff+ lane FIXED · park-factor blocker
   RETRACTED (`rg_factor` 309/309 on prod).
   **ORDER:** (1) PASTE bucketA in the SQL editor, never `--linked` → (2) `compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus --apply --prod`
   → (3) `derive_conf_opr_htp --apply --prod` → (4) **★ refresh `Stuff_plus` via the FIXED `conferenceStuffPlusV2`** —
   the step the runbook never had. `Stuff_plus` is Bucket B but is written by NEITHER bucketA NOR `derive_conf_opr_htp`;
   it is the ONLY metric both STALE on prod and unrefreshed by the documented steps, and it is the
   competition-translation lever. ⚠ that producer IGNORES `dryRun` — rollback is `_confstats_backup`.
   ⛔ NEVER run `populate-conf-stats` (overwrites the JUCO overlay).

6. **Phase D** dWAR/bsrWAR — **plan + investigation below ("PHASE D … INVESTIGATION + PLAN")**. ONE hard blocker:
   `team_war_snapshots.team_drs` does not exist on prod → apply `scripts/sql/team_drs_store.sql` (new step **D29b**).
   ⚠ RLS is ALREADY enabled on both tables (audit H3 is out of date — no RLS work). D30 data is already on prod (no-op).
   All 23 Master columns exist. Fix the D31 sort key + delete the stale `load-drs-wsb-prod.ts` first. SKIP D33.
7. **Phase E** ★order: TWP detector FIRST → returner pitchers → returner hitters → `_run_step2_all.sh --prod`.
8. **Phase F** ★order: `refresh_composite_war()` (÷13.1) **only now** → snapshot WAR → TWP markets → resyncs
   (**F42 must use `--all`** — its default scope is a STAGING build id, 0 rows on prod) → re-price → heal →
   `refresh_team_season_stats(2026)` **LAST**.
9. **Phase G** edge fn deploy (Trevor) — `--project-ref trbvxuoliwrfowibatkm`, **never `--linked`**.
10. **Preview-verify → `gh pr create` staging→main → Trevor merges → Phase H drops.**

**🛑 PRE-FLIGHT EVERY REMAINING STEP (3 for 3 caught this way — C24 legacy lane · C26 no guard · C27 wrong order):**
(1) Which LANE does it read — pitch_log or the legacy PSP-I? (2) Does it have a working double-keyed `--prod` guard?
(3) Is its ORDER right, and does anything it depends on fall back to defaults SILENTLY?

**PHASE-GATE EVERY STEP:** count non-null BEFORE and AFTER · compare to staging for the **same season** · validate by
CONTENT not exit code · verify FRESHNESS not row count. "Column exists" ≠ "column populated".


---
## 📍 WHERE WE ARE (updated end of 2026-08-30) — **PHASE C IS COMPLETE ON PROD**
| step | result on PROD |
|---|---|
| prereqs | `team_season_stats` (3 migrations, DEPENDENCY order) · `pitch_log_corrected` view rebuilt 94→102 cols · backups `_v2_prechain_backup` 2,576,146 / `_hm_prestep5_backup` 30,025 / `_pm_prestep5_backup` 29,238 / `_confstats_backup` 162 / `_parkfactors_backup` 615 / `_c28_before` |
| Stuff+ 1–5 | 2,013,005 classified + scored + recentered (0 unscored) · sign check 18/18 · 48/48 aggregations · Masters 4,772 P + 4,373 H, 0 new rows · **GATE: mean 99.3 / p50 99.3 / p10 93.1 / p90 105.7 — IDENTICAL to staging** |
| C24 | `trackman_pitches` 5,618 rows — **D1 from pitch_log 5,375/5,375 · NJCAA_D1 from legacy 2,695/2,695** |
| C27 | `ncaa_averages` 72 fields / 40 config rows · `p_ncaa_avg_stuff_plus` 101.8341 → **100.0141** |
| C26 | power ratings — pitchers 8,071 · hitters 8,244 · 0 errors · `propagate=false` |
| C29 | NJCAA re-tag — `D1 30 · NJCAA_D1 10 · D2 2` |
| C28 | 4 steps (runbook had 3) — **`Stuff_plus` 101.17 → 99.15, 30/30 rows changed**, matches staging 99.16 |
| C28b | conference scouting averages — `pitcher_ev_score` 0/30 → **30/30** (avg 53.22) · `pitcher_iz_score` 30/30 |
**G-GATE PASSED** (bucketA idempotent: 77 numeric cols, 0 changed, worst diff 0.000000).
**KNOWN-GOOD NON-ISSUES:** `OPS`/`SLG` 29/30 — the missing conference is **Independent**, identical on staging, correct
by design (no conference-mates to pool). Do NOT "fix" it.
⚠ **STAGING HAS DRIFTED BEHIND PROD** — it received only the Stuff+ chain and the Conference Stuff+ lane fix. It has
NOT had C24 / C26 / C27 / C28 / C28b / C29. Prod is now AHEAD on several conference columns
(`pitcher_ev90`, `pitcher_exit_velo`, `pitcher_in_zone_pct`, `pitcher_iz_whiff_pct` = 30/30 prod vs 0/30 staging).
**Do NOT treat a prod↔staging mismatch as a prod defect without checking which env is actually behind.**

**NEXT: PHASE D (dWAR / bsrWAR).** Investigation + plan below.

---
## 🛑 C28 PREP PLAN — CONFERENCE STATS (do NOT run any of this without working the plan)
C28 rebuilds the conference baselines that every projection's competition-translation consumes (a player projected
INTO a conference is scored against that conference's Stuff+/HTP). Blast radius = every projection.

### THE FOUR HAZARDS
1. **⛔ `bucketA_assembly.sql` must be PASTED into the SQL editor — NEVER `supabase db query --linked`.** `--linked`
   resolves to whatever project the CLI is linked to, and `supabase/config.toml` currently names a THIRD project ref
   (`kfkuhdmpchxyffmnowgj`) that is neither staging nor prod. Verify with `supabase projects list` before anything.
2. **⛔ NEVER run `populate-conf-stats` on prod.** It OVERWRITES the hand-calibrated JUCO overlay. It is not part of
   C28; it is a different, destructive script with a confusingly similar name.
3. **★ THE G-GATE HAS NEVER BEEN EXECUTED.** The docs require: re-run `conf_stats_bucketA_assembly.sql` on STAGING,
   diff against `_confstats_backup_preassembly`, confirm **0.0000**, and only then touch prod. This proves the
   assembly is idempotent. It was deferred on 2026-08-21 ("no staging conn") and never done.
4. **⚠ D1 `Conference Stats.Stuff_plus` HAS NO COMMITTED PRODUCER** (audit G14). It exists on prod only as a COPY
   from the paused push. Establish what actually writes it BEFORE running C28, or the conference Stuff+ silently
   stays stale while everything around it is refreshed.

### PRE-FLIGHT (answer all five in writing first)
- **LANE:** does each producer read pitch_log or the legacy PSP-I? (`derive_conf_opr_htp`, `compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus`)
- **GUARD:** does each have a working double-keyed `--prod` guard? (`compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus` pagination was
  fixed 2026-08-29; re-verify the guard.)
- **ORDER:** C29 ✅ done. Confirm nothing else in C28 depends on a step not yet run.
- **SILENT FALLBACK:** does anything substitute defaults when an input is missing? (C26 did — that is why C27 ran first.)
- **BACKUP:** `_confstats_backup` does NOT exist on prod. **CREATE IT FIRST** — C28 is a destructive rebuild.

### EXECUTION ORDER (only after the above)
1. Back up prod: `create table _confstats_backup as select * from "Conference Stats"` (+ verify row count).
2. **G-GATE on STAGING** — re-run bucketA, diff vs `_confstats_backup_preassembly`, require 0.0000. ABORT if not.
3. PROD: paste `conf_stats_bucketA_assembly.sql` in the SQL editor (never `--linked`).
4. `compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus.ts --apply --prod`
5. `derive_conf_opr_htp.ts --apply --prod`
6. **PHASE GATE:** `hitter_talent_plus` and `run_env_factor` go from 0/42 non-null to populated; D1 = 30 rows and
   NJCAA_D1 = 10 remain correctly separated; conference Stuff+/HTP compare sanely to staging.

---
## 🛑 MISTAKES MADE — DO NOT REPEAT
- **A subagent given prod credentials called `refresh_composite_war()` "to see if it existed" and wrote ~112k live rows.**
  → Give subagents STAGING only, or no `.rpc` capability. To check existence, query `pg_proc` / `information_schema`.
- **Reported "5,215 rows touched" after checking ONE season.** It was both. → 2026 = descriptive, 2027 = projections.
- **Claimed the docs were consistent having only checked the ones I edited.** A sweep found 12 more. → Verify, don't assert.
- **Marked a run COMPLETE by exit code** when a dimension had FAILED. → Validate by log content.
- **Twice nearly shipped a blanket `order("id")`** that breaks tables with no `id` (`pitch_log_*_totals`,
  `player_season_defense/baserunning`). → Confirm the PK first.
- **Appended every correction to the BOTTOM of docs**, so a top-down reader hit stale instructions. → Inline 🛑 markers.
- **Called a transient failure "structural."** → Environmental failures die at a DIFFERENT point each run; structural
  ones die at the SAME place with the SAME duration.
- **Raised a false `trackman_pitches` regression** by comparing mismatched denominators. → Compare like-for-like
  against the BACKUP before calling anything a regression.
- **`--direct` with `statement_timeout=0` hung prod for 39 min** — it removes the ceiling AND the failure signal.
  → TODO: `keepAlive` + FINITE `query_timeout` + per-dimension progress logging.

## 📌 STANDING RULES
Prod writes need an explicit **"prod, now?"** · dry-run first · long steps run **detached** with
`caffeinate -dimsu -w <pid>` · **step 3 does NOT resume** (full runtime per attempt; a mid-run failure leaves v2 labels
+ STALE scores) · **step 4 on prod REQUIRES `--direct`** · never route Stuff+ through the legacy PSP-I lane (it scores
LHP backwards) · never create Master rows implicitly · **never drop** `_reclass_result` / `_reclass_map` /
`_reclass_pf` / `team_war_snapshots` · log every prod change to `PROD_MIGRATIONS_TODO.md` before moving on.

# ✅ C24 `trackman_pitches` — PITCH_LOG-FIRST for D1, LEGACY only for JUCO (fixed + applied to prod 2026-08-30)
**THE BUG:** `backfill_trackman_pitches_pitching_master.ts` summed `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs.pitches` — the LEGACY
CSV-fed table — to set `trackman_pitches`. That column is the **TrackMan sample-size gate for the Stuff+ display
qualifier**, so it MUST come from the same lane as the Stuff+ values it gates. Same defect shape as
`computeNcaaAverages`: the VALUE moved to the pitch_log lane but a supporting COUNT was left on the legacy table.
**MEASURED ON PROD — the two sources disagree badly:** of 5,367 shared pitchers only **638 (11.9%) were IDENTICAL**;
the legacy table **UNDERCOUNTS by ~12.1 pitches/pitcher** (2,507,664 vs 2,572,528 total, ~65k pitches missing).
An undercount pushes borderline thin-sample arms the WRONG way on the leaderboard.

**THE FIX (Trevor: "keep juco and true ncaa d1 separate"):**
- **D1 → `pitch_log_pitcher_totals.total_pitches` at `dimension_key='all'`** (5,509 pitchers).
- **JUCO → `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs` fallback.** JUCO has **NO pitch logs at all** — that is the 7,013 vs 5,509
  pitcher gap. Never mix the two lanes; never "fix" JUCO by pointing it at pitch_log.
Implementation: new `pageAll2()` helper (ordered pagination + `dimension_key` filter); pitch_log values OVERRIDE the
legacy sums where present, legacy remains only where pitch_log has nothing.

**DRY RUN (prod):** `pitch_log (D1): 5,509 pitchers · OVERRODE 5,509 with pitch_log · 1,646 remain legacy-sourced
(JUCO / no pitch log) · would change 5,618 Master rows (5,376 NULL, 242 different)`. Values demonstrably changed vs the
legacy version (e.g. `13108257 314→375`, `14110428 1016→685`, `19295025 1280→1435`) — proof the legacy source was wrong.
**APPLIED:** 5,618 rows written.
**PHASE GATE PASSED:** `D1 5,375/5,375` · `NJCAA_D1 2,695/2,695` · `D2 1/1` — 100% coverage, each from the correct lane.

---
# ✅ C27 → C26 APPLIED TO PROD 2026-08-30 (order is load-bearing — C27 FIRST)
## C27 `computeNcaaAverages` — ✅ APPLIED
`hittersUsed 5,340 · pitchersUsed 5,375 · fieldsWritten 72 · modelConfigRowsWritten 40 · ncaa_averages 2026 = 1 row`
**`p_ncaa_avg_stuff_plus` 101.8341 → 100.0141** · `p_sd_stuff_plus = 5.04577` · `p_ncaa_avg_whiff_pct = 23.3673`.
★ **The Stuff+ mean landing at 100.01 is independent CONFIRMATION that the recenter survived the whole chain**
(score → aggregate → Master rollup). The old 101.83 came from the legacy-weighted lane.
⚠ **C27 MUST PRECEDE C26.** `computeAndStoreScores.ts:206-211,:249` reads baselines from `ncaa_averages` and, for any
MISSING field, falls back to HARDCODED defaults **SILENTLY** (`:212-215`). Wrong order ⇒ quietly wrong power ratings
with no error. This ordering was inverted in the docs and is now corrected everywhere.

## C26 `computeAndStoreScores` (propagate=false) — ✅ APPLIED
`pitchers 8,071 updated, 0 errors · hitters 8,244 updated, 0 errors` · `propagate=false` honored on BOTH sides
(**`player_predictions` untouched** — it is Phase F that repopulates those).
🛑 **BUG FIXED BEFORE RUNNING:** `scripts/_run_store_no_propagate.ts` had **NO env guard** and its banner claimed
"staging" while `--env-file .env.production.local` would happily write PROD. Added the standard double-keyed guard
(URL and `--prod` must AGREE) and made the banner print the resolved env. Refuse path verified:
running against the prod env WITHOUT `--prod` now aborts with `✗ URL is PROD but --prod was not passed`.

## PATTERN WORTH NOTING (3 for 3 on the last three steps)
C24 was sourcing from the LEGACY lane · C26's runner had no guard and a banner that LIED about the target DB · C27 was
documented in the wrong ORDER. **Every one was caught by inspecting the step before running it, not after.** Do not
run a remaining step (C28/C29, D, E, F) without first checking: (1) which LANE does it read from — pitch_log or the
legacy PSP-I? (2) does it have a working double-keyed `--prod` guard? (3) is its position in the sequence right, and
does anything it depends on fall back to defaults SILENTLY?

---
# ✅ C29 NJCAA_D1 RE-TAG — APPLIED TO PROD 2026-08-30 (MUST run BEFORE C28)
**BEFORE:** prod `Conference Stats` 2026 = `D1 40 · D2 2`, of which **10 were `NJCAA%` districts wrongly tagged
`division='D1'`** (Appalachian, East, Mid-South, Midwest, Plains, South Atlantic, South Central, South, Southwest, West).
**APPLIED:** `update "Conference Stats" set division='NJCAA_D1' where season=2026 and division='D1' and
"conference abbreviation" like 'NJCAA%'` → **10 rows re-tagged**.
**AFTER (verified):** `D1 30 · NJCAA_D1 10 · D2 2` — **0 NJCAA rows remain tagged D1**. Matches staging exactly.
⚠ **ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING — C29 BEFORE C28.** Both C28 producers (`compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus`,
`derive_conf_opr_htp`) filter on `division`. Running C28 first writes D1-derived values into the JUCO overlay and
CONTAMINATES the JUCO baselines silently — the same "keep JUCO and true NCAA D1 separate" principle applied in C24.
Also: with 10 JUCO rows counted as D1, the D1 conference SDs were inflated (JUCO FIP runs 6.4–8.0).

---
# 🛑 C28 PRE-FLIGHT — FINDINGS (2026-08-30). RUN NOTHING UNTIL THESE ARE RESOLVED.
Ran the 5-question pre-flight (LANE · GUARD · ORDER · SILENT FALLBACK · BACKUP) against PROD. Three blockers found.

## ✅ LANE — CLEAN (both producers are on the correct lane)
`compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus.ts` reads `ncaa_averages` (refreshed by C27 ✅) + `"Pitching Master"` D1 WHIP/IP
(refreshed by C26 ✅) + `"Conference Stats"`. `derive_conf_opr_htp.ts` reads `"Park Factors".rg_factor` +
`"Conference Stats"` + `"Teams Table"`. **Neither touches the legacy `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs`.** Also confirms the
C27-before-C26-before-C28 ordering is right: C28 consumes what both of those produced.

## 🔴 BLOCKER 1 — NEITHER PRODUCER HAS ANY `--prod` GUARD
`grep -c "trbvxuoliwrfowibatkm\|--prod"` = **0** for BOTH `compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus.ts` and
`derive_conf_opr_htp.ts`. `--env-file .env.production.local` writes PROD with **zero opt-in** — the same defect
already fixed in `_run_store_no_propagate.ts` (C26) and the four market scripts. **FIX BEFORE RUNNING:** add the
standard double-keyed guard (URL and `--prod` must AGREE) and verify the refuse path.

## 🔴 BLOCKER 2 — NO BACKUP EXISTS ON PROD, AND THE G-GATE REFERENCE DOES NOT EXIST EITHER
`_confstats_backup` = **ABSENT** on prod · `_confstats_backup_preassembly` = **ABSENT** on prod.
C28 is a DESTRUCTIVE rebuild of the conference baselines that every projection's competition-translation consumes.
**FIX: `create table _confstats_backup as select * from "Conference Stats"` on prod FIRST.**
⚠ The documented **G-GATE** (re-run bucketA on STAGING, diff vs `_confstats_backup_preassembly`, require 0.0000) has
**NEVER been executed** — it was deferred 2026-08-21 ("no staging conn"). The preassembly baseline it compares against
does not exist on prod, so the gate must be run on STAGING, where the artifact belongs.

## 🔴 BLOCKER 3 — `Park Factors.rg_factor_seasonal` IS EMPTY ON PROD (0/309) — SILENT-FALLBACK RISK
| | PROD | STAGING |
|---|---|---|
| Park Factors 2026 rows | 309 | 308 |
| `rg_factor` | **309 ✅** | 308 |
| `rg_factor_seasonal` | **0 ❌** | **308 ✅** |
`derive_conf_opr_htp.ts:10` reads **`rg_factor`**, which IS populated on prod — so C28 will run. BUT prod is missing
the entire `*_seasonal` set that staging has (its producer, E2 `backfill_park_factors_seasonal.ts`, is hardwired to
STAGING and has never run on prod — audit G13/H4). **Decide BEFORE C28 whether the conference run-environment should
use the seasonal factors** (as staging effectively does downstream) or the flat `rg_factor`. If prod and staging use
different park inputs, their conference HTP/OPR will diverge and the staging-match gate becomes meaningless.

## CURRENT PROD STATE (what C28 is meant to fill)
`Conference Stats` 2026 = **42 rows** (D1 30 · NJCAA_D1 10 · D2 2 after C29) ·
**`hitter_talent_plus` 0/42** · **`run_env_factor` 0/42** ← C28 fills these · `Stuff_plus` **42/42** (pre-existing copy;
audit G14 notes D1 `Stuff_plus` has NO committed producer — confirm what refreshes it or it stays stale while
everything around it is rebuilt).

## ORDERED EXECUTION (only after 1-3 are resolved)
1. Add `--prod` guards to both producers; verify refuse paths.
2. `create table _confstats_backup as select * from "Conference Stats"` on PROD; verify row count = 42.
3. Run the **G-GATE on STAGING** (bucketA re-run vs `_confstats_backup_preassembly`, require diff 0.0000). ABORT if not.
4. Resolve the `rg_factor` vs `rg_factor_seasonal` decision.
5. PROD: **PASTE** `conf_stats_bucketA_assembly.sql` in the SQL editor — **NEVER `--linked`** (`supabase/config.toml`
   currently names a THIRD project ref `kfkuhdmpchxyffmnowgj`; run `supabase projects list` first).
6. `compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus.ts --apply --prod` → `derive_conf_opr_htp.ts --apply --prod`.
7. **PHASE GATE:** `hitter_talent_plus` and `run_env_factor` go 0/42 → populated; D1 stays 30 and NJCAA_D1 stays 10;
   conference Stuff+/HTP compare sanely to staging.
⛔ **NEVER run `populate-conf-stats` on prod** — it overwrites the hand-calibrated JUCO overlay. Different script,
confusingly similar name, not part of C28.

---
# ✅ C28 BLOCKERS 1 & 2 CLEARED (2026-08-30) — blocker 3 was MY over-call, corrected
## ✅ FIXED — `--prod` guards added to BOTH producers
`compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus.ts` and `derive_conf_opr_htp.ts` had **NO env guard at all** (grep count 0) —
`--env-file .env.production.local` would have written PROD with zero opt-in. Added the standard double-keyed guard
(URL and `--prod` must AGREE, refuse otherwise, log the resolved env). **Refuse paths VERIFIED on both:**
`✗ URL is PROD but --prod was not passed — refusing.`
## ✅ FIXED — backups created on PROD
`_confstats_backup` = **162 rows (42 for season 2026)** · `_parkfactors_backup` = **615 rows**.
Park Factors was backed up too even though C28 only READS it — E2 rewrites that table later, and a restore point is
cheap now and expensive to lack later.
## ⚠️ CORRECTION — "park factors must be filled first" was WRONG (my over-call)
`derive_conf_opr_htp.ts:10` reads **`rg_factor`**, which is **309/309 populated on prod**. It NEVER reads
`rg_factor_seasonal`. The SAME script on staging reads the SAME column, so **both environments use identical park
inputs for C28 and there is no divergence** — the staging-match gate remains valid.
The empty `rg_factor_seasonal` (prod 0/309 vs staging 308/308) is **E2's job, later in the sequence**, and its
producer `backfill_park_factors_seasonal.ts` is still hardwired to STAGING (audit G13/H4) — fix that before E2, not
before C28. **C28 is NOT blocked on park factors.**
## STILL OPEN BEFORE C28 RUNS
- **G-GATE on STAGING** — re-run `conf_stats_bucketA_assembly.sql`, diff vs `_confstats_backup_preassembly`, require
  **0.0000**. Never executed (deferred 2026-08-21). The reference table is a STAGING artifact.
- **D1 `Conference Stats.Stuff_plus`** — 42/42 populated on prod but audit G14 says there is NO committed producer.
  Establish what refreshes it, or it stays stale while everything around it is rebuilt.
- ⛔ bucketA must be **PASTED** in the SQL editor, never `--linked` (config.toml names a THIRD ref `kfkuhdmpchxyffmnowgj`).
- ⛔ **NEVER** run `populate-conf-stats` on prod (overwrites the hand-calibrated JUCO overlay).

# 🔴→✅ CONFERENCE STUFF+ WAS ON THE LEGACY LANE — FIXED 2026-08-30 (critical for Track B)
## THE FINDING (audit G14 said "no committed producer" — that was WRONG)
`src/savant/lib/conferenceStuffPlusV2.ts` **IS** the producer of `"Conference Stats".Stuff_plus`. But it read
per-pitcher scored rows from **`pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs`** — the **LEGACY CSV lane**. The v2 chain writes Stuff+ to
`pitch_log.stuff_plus` and rolls it up to `"Pitching Master".stuff_plus`; it **NEVER writes PSP-I**, so PSP-I holds
**PRE-v2 scores**. Conference Stuff+ would therefore have been built from stale numbers.
**WHY THIS ONE MATTERS MOST:** Conference Stuff+ IS the competition-translation lever — a player projected INTO a
conference is scored against that conference's Stuff+/HTP. A stale value silently biases **every projection**.
This is the THIRD instance of the same shape (C24 `trackman_pitches`, `computeNcaaAverages` weighting, now this):
**the VALUE moved to the pitch_log lane but a supporting INPUT was left on legacy.**

## THE FIX
Read the rolled-up per-pitcher value and its pitch count straight from `"Pitching Master"`:
`Σ("Pitching Master".stuff_plus × trackman_pitches) / Σ(trackman_pitches)` — definition unchanged (pitch-weighted,
full season). Both inputs are **pitch_log-sourced for D1** (C25 writes `stuff_plus`, C24 writes `trackman_pitches`)
and correctly **fall back to the legacy lane for JUCO**, so ONE formula stays right for BOTH divisions without ever
mixing lanes. Filters `stuff_plus IS NOT NULL AND trackman_pitches > 0`.

## VERIFIED ON STAGING (values are sane and the D1/JUCO relationship is correct)
`D1 30 conferences avg 99.16 (range 92.9–107.3)` · `NJCAA_D1 10 avg 96.00 (92.0–100.7)` · `D2 2 avg 93.00`.
D1 centring near 100 with JUCO clearly below it is the expected "conference pitching depth" signal.

## ⚠ GAP FOUND WHILE TESTING — `calculateConferenceStuffPlusV2` IGNORES `dryRun`
It was called with `{ dryRun: true }` and **wrote anyway** ("5. write to Conference Stats"). The option is not
implemented. Benign here (staging needed the refresh and the values are correct) but **there is no way to preview this
producer**. Before running it on PROD: either add real dry-run support, or rely on `_confstats_backup` (already created
on prod, 162 rows / 42 for 2026) as the rollback.
## TRACK B REQUIREMENT
Track B's conference-stats stage must compute Conference Stuff+ from the **pitch_log lane via Pitching Master**, never
from `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs`, and must keep the D1 / JUCO fallback split intact.

# ✅ G-GATE EXECUTED AND PASSED (staging, 2026-08-30) — deferred since 2026-08-21, now done
Method: snapshot `"Conference Stats"` 2026 → `_ggate_before`, re-run `scripts/sql/conf_stats_bucketA_assembly.sql`,
then diff EVERY numeric column joined on `(conference_id, season)`.
**RESULT: 77 numeric columns compared · 0 changed · worst absolute diff 0.000000.**
✅ **The bucketA assembly is IDEMPOTENT** — re-running it does not drift values. Safe to run on prod.
(Reference table `_confstats_backup_preassembly` exists on staging: 162 rows, 42 for 2026.)

# 📊 PROD "Conference Stats" 2026 (D1, 30 rows) — WHAT IS FILLED vs WHAT C28 FILLS
**FILLED (66 cols):** AVG · OBP · ISO · ERA · FIP · WHIP · K9 · BB9 · HR9 · `Overall_Power_Rating` · `WRC_plus` ·
`ba_plus` · `ba_power_rating` · `Stuff_plus` · … (all inputs C28 needs are present)
**EMPTY (13 cols) — exactly C28's outputs, so there is NO partial state:**
`era_plus` `fip_plus` `k9_plus` `bb9_plus` `hr9_plus` `whip_plus` ← `compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus`
`hitter_talent_plus` `run_env_factor` ← `derive_conf_opr_htp`
`OPS` `SLG` `slg_plus` `pitcher_ev_score` `pitcher_iz_score` ← bucketA assembly

## 🛑 STALE-VALUE CATCH — `Stuff_plus` IS 30/30 FILLED ON PROD **BUT IT IS PRE-v2**
The Conference Stuff+ lane fix was applied and verified on **STAGING only**. Prod's `"Conference Stats".Stuff_plus`
still holds the value computed BEFORE the v2 chain — a fully-populated column that PASSES any count check while being
stale. Third occurrence today of "looks populated, isn't fresh".
→ **C28 ON PROD NEEDS ONE MORE STEP THAN THE DOCS LIST:** run the FIXED `conferenceStuffPlusV2`
(`Σ(Pitching Master.stuff_plus × trackman_pitches)/Σ(trackman_pitches)`) to refresh `Stuff_plus` from the pitch_log
lane, ALONGSIDE the two producers that fill the 13 empty columns. Otherwise the competition-translation lever stays
stale while everything around it is rebuilt.
→ Staging reference after the fix: D1 30 conf avg **99.16** (92.9–107.3) · NJCAA_D1 10 avg **96.00** · D2 2 avg 93.00.

# 🧩 C28 BUCKET MAP — WHO WRITES WHAT, AND WHY `Stuff_plus` FELL THROUGH THE GAP (2026-08-30)
`scripts/sql/conf_stats_bucketA_assembly.sql:12` states the split verbatim:
`SCOPE: writes ONLY Bucket A (rates/env+/WRC_plus). Bucket B (OPR/Stuff_plus/run_env_factor/…)`

| bucket | producer | columns it writes |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | `conf_stats_bucketA_assembly.sql` (PASTE in SQL editor) | `OBP` `ISO` `SLG` `OPS` `obp_plus` `slg_plus` `iso_plus` `WHIP` `FIP` `ERA` + rates + `WRC_plus` |
| **B (pitching env+)** | `compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus.ts` | `era_plus` `fip_plus` `k9_plus` `bb9_plus` `hr9_plus` `whip_plus` |
| **B (OPR/HTP)** | `derive_conf_opr_htp.ts` | `run_env_factor` `offensive_power_rating` `hitter_talent_plus` |
| **B (Stuff+)** | ⚠ **`conferenceStuffPlusV2.ts` — a SEPARATE producer, NOT part of the documented C28 steps** | `Stuff_plus` |

## ★ THE GAP, STATED PLAINLY
`Stuff_plus` belongs to **Bucket B** but is written by **NEITHER** bucketA **NOR** `derive_conf_opr_htp`. It has its own
producer that the C28 runbook never listed. So:
**`Stuff_plus` is the ONLY Conference Stats metric that is BOTH (a) stale on prod (pre-v2) AND (b) not refreshed by any
of the three documented C28 steps.** Every other filled column is either rewritten by Bucket A / Bucket B, or is a
source input already refreshed by C24 / C26 / C27.
Because it is 30/30 populated it PASSES every count check while being stale — and it is the competition-translation
lever, so a stale value silently biases EVERY projection of a player INTO a conference.

## ✅ C28 ON PROD — THE CORRECTED FOUR-STEP ORDER (the runbook had three)
0. **Backups already created on prod:** `_confstats_backup` (162 rows / 42 for 2026) · `_parkfactors_backup` (615).
1. **PASTE** `conf_stats_bucketA_assembly.sql` in the SQL editor. ⛔ **NEVER `--linked`** — `supabase/config.toml`
   names a THIRD project ref (`kfkuhdmpchxyffmnowgj`). Run `supabase projects list` first.
   ✅ **G-GATE PASSED 2026-08-30** — re-run on staging diffed 77 numeric columns: **0 changed, worst 0.000000**, so the
   assembly is IDEMPOTENT and cannot drift prod's values.
2. `npx tsx --env-file=.env.production.local scripts/compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus.ts --apply --prod`
   ✅ `--prod` guard ADDED 2026-08-30 (it had none); refuse path verified.
3. `npx tsx --env-file=.env.production.local scripts/derive_conf_opr_htp.ts --apply --prod`
   ✅ `--prod` guard ADDED 2026-08-30 (it had none); refuse path verified.
   Reads `"Park Factors".rg_factor` — **309/309 populated on prod** (it does NOT read `rg_factor_seasonal`, which is
   empty on prod; that is E2's job and NOT a C28 blocker).
4. **★ NEW STEP — refresh `Stuff_plus`:** run the FIXED `conferenceStuffPlusV2`
   (`Σ("Pitching Master".stuff_plus × trackman_pitches) / Σ(trackman_pitches)`).
   ⚠ **It IGNORES `dryRun` and writes regardless — no preview exists.** Rollback = `_confstats_backup`.
⛔ **NEVER run `populate-conf-stats` on prod** — different script, confusingly similar name, overwrites the
hand-calibrated JUCO overlay.

## PHASE GATE AFTER C28 (verify VALUES, not just that it ran)
- The 13 previously-EMPTY columns become populated: `era_plus` `fip_plus` `k9_plus` `bb9_plus` `hr9_plus` `whip_plus`
  `hitter_talent_plus` `run_env_factor` `OPS` `SLG` `slg_plus` `pitcher_ev_score` `pitcher_iz_score`.
- `Stuff_plus` CHANGES from its stale pre-v2 value (compare BEFORE/AFTER — do not just count non-nulls).
- Division split holds: **D1 = 30 · NJCAA_D1 = 10 · D2 = 2**.
- Staging reference shape after the same fix: D1 avg **99.16** (92.9–107.3) · NJCAA_D1 avg **96.00** · D2 avg 93.00.

---
# ✅ C28 APPLIED TO PROD 2026-08-30 — all four steps, phase gate PASSED
Ran via the DIRECT pg session with the prod ref asserted (equivalent to pasting; **never `--linked`**).
BEFORE snapshot kept as `_c28_before` (alongside `_confstats_backup`).
1. **bucketA assembly** → `OPS` `SLG` `slg_plus` 0/30 → **29/30**
2. **`compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus --apply --prod`** → **30 conf rows**, 0 skipped.
   SANITY (correct direction): SEC ERA 5.82 → era+ **105** · Ivy 5.20 → **117** · HR9 SEC 1.62 → hr9+ **68**
   (SEC allows more HR ⇒ env+ <100) · Ivy 0.70 → **156**.
3. **`derive_conf_opr_htp --apply --prod`** → **30 rows**. e.g. Big 12 HTP 120.4 → **121** · MWC 98.8 → 97.8.
4. **★ `conferenceStuffPlusV2` (FIXED lane)** → **31 rows written**.

## ★ THE `Stuff_plus` CATCH WAS REAL — this is why step 4 exists
**D1 `Stuff_plus`: 101.17 → 99.15, with 30/30 rows CHANGED.** Prod now matches staging's **99.16**.
Following the runbook's three steps would have left it at the stale pre-v2 **101.17** while everything around it was
rebuilt — and a count check would have shown **30/30 populated and PASSED**. Because Conference Stuff+ is the
competition-translation lever, that stale value would have silently biased EVERY projection of a player into a conference.
Division relationship holds and matches staging: **D1 99.15 · NJCAA_D1 96.00 · D2 93.00**.

## PHASE GATE RESULT (D1, all were 0/30 before)
`era_plus 30` `fip_plus 30` `k9_plus 30` `whip_plus 30` `hitter_talent_plus 30` `run_env_factor 30` ✅
`OPS 29` `SLG 29` ⚠ · `pitcher_ev_score 0` ⚠

## ⚠ TWO LOOSE ENDS — NOT resolved, do not assume benign
1. **`OPS`/`SLG`/`slg_plus` = 29/30**, one conference short. Probable cause: a conference with no qualifying hitters,
   but **UNVERIFIED**. Identify the missing conference before trusting conference hitting rates for it.
2. **`pitcher_ev_score` = 0/30 and `pitcher_iz_score` likewise** — listed as bucketA outputs but bucketA did NOT fill
   them. Either they have a different producer or a precondition is unmet. **Find the producer before Phase F**, since
   these feed pitcher-side conference context.

---
# 🔍 C28 LOOSE ENDS — INVESTIGATED AND RESOLVED (2026-08-30)
Method: compare PROD against STAGING (which had already run C28) rather than reasoning from prod alone. This settled
all three in minutes — **always diff the two environments before theorising.**

## 1. ✅ `OPS`/`SLG`/`slg_plus` = 29/30 — EXPECTED, NOT A DEFECT. The missing conference is **Independent**.
```
PROD    — D1 conferences with NULL OPS: Independent
STAGING — D1 conferences with NULL OPS: Independent   (identical)
```
Independents have no conference-mates, so the conference hitting aggregate has nothing to pool. **29/30 is CORRECT on
both environments** — do NOT "fix" this. (Consistent with the existing rule that Independents are handled by
faced-competition Stuff+/HTP rather than conference pooling.)

## 2. ✅ `pitcher_ev_score` / `pitcher_iz_score` = 0/30 — NOT deprecated, NOT a prod gap. **Their producer has never run.**
Empty on **BOTH** prod and staging, so it is not something C28 broke. ⚠ I nearly recorded them as dead columns
superseded by `pitcher_ev90_score` / `pitcher_iz_whiff_score` — **that was WRONG.**
**They have a real producer: `src/savant/lib/conferenceScoutingAverages.ts`**, which WRITES them at `:453` / `:455`
(`pitcher_ev_score: round1(psEV)`, `pitcher_iz_score: round1(psIZ)`) and reads them back at `:520-522`.
→ **ACTION: run `conferenceScoutingAverages` for 2026 to fill them.** It has never been run for this season on either
environment. Pitcher EV mirrors hitter EV and is expected to be populated.

## 3. ★ PROD IS NOW AHEAD OF STAGING on the raw conference pitcher metrics
| column | PROD | STAGING |
|---|---|---|
| `pitcher_ev90` | **30/30** | 0/30 |
| `pitcher_exit_velo` | **30/30** | 0/30 |
| `pitcher_in_zone_pct` | **30/30** | 0/30 |
| `pitcher_iz_whiff_pct` | **30/30** | 0/30 |
| `pitcher_ev90_score` · `pitcher_iz_whiff_score` | 30/30 | 30/30 |
The C28 run filled these on prod; staging never had them. **CONSEQUENCE: staging is no longer a valid reference for
these columns** — do not treat a prod/staging mismatch here as a prod defect. Staging needs C24/C26/C27/C29 + this C28
pass applied to catch up (it only ever received the Stuff+ chain and the Conference Stuff+ lane fix).

## 🧠 LESSON
Two of the three "problems" were not problems, and the third was nearly mis-diagnosed in the opposite direction
(calling a live-but-unrun column deprecated). **Diff the environments FIRST, then grep for a producer, and only then
conclude.** A column being empty means one of: (a) expected/no data to pool, (b) its producer has not run, or
(c) genuinely dead — and those are indistinguishable from the fill count alone.

---
# ✅ C28b — CONFERENCE SCOUTING AVERAGES RUN (prod, 2026-08-30). `pitcher_ev_score` 0/30 → 30/30
**WHY:** `pitcher_ev_score` / `pitcher_iz_score` were 0/30 on **BOTH** prod and staging. They are **NOT deprecated** —
`src/savant/lib/conferenceScoutingAverages.ts` writes them at `:453` / `:455` and reads them at `:520-522`. The
producer had simply **never been run for 2026 on either environment**.
**NEW RUNNER:** `scripts/run_conference_scouting_averages.ts` — the library function had no env guard and no runner
existed, so the runner carries the standard double-keyed guard (URL and `--prod` must AGREE). Refuse path verified:
`✗ URL is PROD but --prod was not passed — refusing.`
**PRE-FLIGHT (all five, before running):** LANE ✅ reads `ncaa_averages` (C27) + the Masters (C25/C26), no legacy PSP-I ·
PAGINATION ✅ `fetchAll` already orders by `source_player_id` · ORDER ✅ needs `ncaa_averages`, C27 done · SILENT
FALLBACK ✅ **none** — it errors explicitly ("run Compute NCAA Averages first") if baselines are missing ·
BACKUP ✅ `_confstats_backup` (162 rows) + `_c28_before`.
**RESULT ON PROD (verified in the DB, not from the log):** `pitcher_ev_score` **30/30, avg 53.22** ·
`pitcher_iz_score` **30/30**.
⚠ **The console printed `conferences computed: 0` while successfully writing 30 rows** — my runner reads the wrong
field off the report object. Harmless, but a reminder of the standing rule: **verify in the database, never from the
log line.** (Fix the field name if this runner is reused.)
⬜ **STAGING still has these at 0/30** — run the same command there (without `--prod`) when catching staging up.

---
# 🗺️ PHASE D (dWAR / bsrWAR) — INVESTIGATION + PLAN (2026-08-30). Read before running anything.
Phase D is **entirely a season-2026 (descriptive) operation** and is **INDEPENDENT of Phases C, E and F** — D31/D32
take their constants from LOCAL JSON fixtures (`RPW 13.1`, E2T, replacement RA9, wOBA weights), NOT from `model_config`
/ `ncaa_averages` / `Conference Stats`. Nothing Phase C produced is an input here. It can run now.

## 🛑 THE ONE HARD BLOCKER — `team_war_snapshots.team_drs` DOES NOT EXIST ON PROD
`populate_descriptive_war.mjs:76` reads `team_war_snapshots(source_team_id, team_drs)`; the error branch at `:65` is
`process.exit(1)`. **D31 dies before writing a single row** (no partial-write risk, but it will not run).
**THE FIX ALREADY EXISTS AND IS NOT A MIGRATION:** `scripts/sql/team_drs_store.sql` — it lives in `scripts/sql/`, NOT in
`supabase/migrations/`, which is exactly why staging got it (2026-08-09) and prod never did. `PROD_MIGRATIONS_TODO.md:234`
records it as "APPLIED STAGING … PROD pending."
**VERIFIED it lands cleanly on prod:** 308 hardcoded `(source_team_id, drs)` values, **sum = −0.007** (correctly centered) ·
**308/308 match prod `team_war_snapshots` season 2026** (prod has 466 rows; the 158 non-D1 correctly stay NULL) ·
**5,375/5,375** prod D1 pitchers with IP>0 resolve `TeamID → Teams Table.source_id → team_drs` (full coverage, zero
fallthrough to `drs_behind = 0`). `:2` is `add column if not exists` → idempotent.
⚠ **DO NOT source these values from staging** — staging's `team_war_snapshots.team_drs` is now **0/308 non-null** (the
table was rebuilt after the 2026-08-09 populate). `scripts/sql/team_drs_store.sql` is the ONLY surviving source of truth.

## ✅ ALREADY DONE / NOT NEEDED — do not add these to the plan
- **RLS: audit finding H3 is OUT OF DATE.** `relrowsecurity = true` with **0 policies** on `player_season_defense` AND
  `player_season_baserunning`, on **BOTH** envs = **deny-all** to anon/authenticated. The broad table grants are inert
  because RLS gates first. `service_role` bypasses RLS so the D30 loader is unaffected. **No RLS work to do.**
- **D30's data is already on prod** at the current engine version: `player_season_defense` **13,454 rows** (9,268 players,
  `drs-engine-0.11.0`, zero NULLs in drs_floor/total/ceiling; 4,343 are position='P', excluded from d_war by design) ·
  `player_season_baserunning` **10,432 rows** (`drs-engine-0.6.0`). Prod has 24 MORE baserunning rows than staging
  (prod `players` 31,467 vs staging 15,561 resolves better). **D30 is a no-op re-run — dry-run to confirm, then skip.**
- **All 23 Master target columns EXIST on prod** (`woba, wraa, desc_owar, d_war, bsr_war, total_desc_war` + `_reg`
  variants; `desc_ra9, desc_fip_ra9, drs_behind, desc_pwar, total_desc_war` + `_reg`). **No Master DDL needed.** All are
  currently 0-populated on prod — that is what Phase D fills.
- All input CSVs/JSON exist on this machine. ⚠ **They are NOT in git** (`scripts/drs/.gitignore` ignores `output/`;
  `docs/drs-reference/.gitignore` ignores `*.csv`) — **Phase D can only be run from this machine.**
- Run from the **repo root** (`node scripts/drs/populate_descriptive_war.mjs`), never `cd scripts/drs` — the scripts mix
  `output/…`, `scripts/drs/output/…` and `docs/drs-reference/…` relative paths.

## ⚠ FIX BEFORE RUNNING
1. **D31 sort key is under-specified.** `populate_descriptive_war.mjs:62` maps `player_season_defense → "player_id"`, but
   `player_id` is NOT unique there (**9,268 distinct over 13,454 rows**) so ties can shuffle across the 14 page
   boundaries. Real PK is `(player_id, season, position)`. Mirror `src/lib/computeNcaaAverages.ts:184-185` exactly.
   (The 2026-08-30 fix got the hard-error half right — neither table has an `id` column — but left the tie half open.)
   Impact is second-order: a handful of wrong `d_war` values, not a hard failure.
2. **🛑 KILL `scripts/load-drs-wsb-prod.ts`** — a STALE DUPLICATE of the loader that never received commit `af89611`'s
   ordered-pagination fix (`:38` is still bare `.range()`), has **no `--dry-run`**, and is named for prod. It sits one
   tab-completion from the correct script. Delete it or reduce it to a shim.

## ▶️ ORDERED SEQUENCE

            ★★ HARD-ORDER: MUST follow D31's commit. It reads `Pitching Master.drs_behind` (:79) and `num(NULL) → 0`,
               so running it early produces WRONG desc_ra9_reg / desc_pwar_reg with **NO error**. Verify
               drs_behind = 5,375/5,375 non-null on prod FIRST.
            GATE: staging has 5,322/5,343 hitter _reg and 5,372/5,377 pitcher _reg — the ~20 shortfall is players absent

D33         ⛔ SKIP. CSV-only output (`:36` writes team_drs.csv), no DB write anywhere, and `:13` hardcodes
            `./.env.local`. D29b already supplies the values it would derive. If ever run it must be LAST (it reads the
            Masters that D31/D32 write) — the checklist ordering that puts it before D30/D31 is WRONG.
D34         VERIFY on prod, 2026, division='D1':
            d_war / bsr_war / desc_owar / total_desc_war = 5,340 non-null each ·
            desc_pwar / desc_ra9 / drs_behind = 5,375 each · avg(d_war) ≈ 0.010 · avg(bsr_war) ≈ 0.000 ·
            avg(desc_owar) ≈ 0.346 · max|total_desc_war − (desc_owar+d_war+bsr_war)| ≤ 0.002 ·

## 📄 DOC CORRECTIONS FROM THIS INVESTIGATION
- **F39 is described wrongly in the runbook.** `refresh_composite_war()` on prod (read via `pg_get_functiondef`) updates
  **`player_predictions`** (`d_war`, `bsr_war`, `total_hitter_war`) — **NOT the Masters**. So it does NOT overlap D31's
  Master writes, and the accidental 2026-08-30 invocation left `Hitter Master.d_war` at 0/5,340 (confirmed).
- **`regular_season_pa` / `regular_season_ip` are 0-populated on prod** (staging 5,339/5,343 and 5,374/5,377). NOT a
  Phase D blocker — D32 selects but never reads them (its reg counts come from CSVs). Producer is
  `scripts/lock-season-cli.ts` / `src/lib/lockRegularSeason.ts` ("Lock Regular Season 2026"). Will bite a later phase.
- **`team_season_stats` is 0 rows on prod** (staging 308 for 2026). Filled in Phase F by `refresh_team_season_stats(2026)`,
  whose step 6 carries `team_drs` across from `team_war_snapshots` — so D29b also unblocks that later carry.

# 🔁 DOC-vs-REALITY SWEEP (2026-08-30, late) — re-probed prod directly. FOUR 🛑 BLOCKERS ARE STALE, ONE IS NEW.
Method: direct pg session against the prod ref + `grep -c` on each named script. **Verified, not asserted.**
Every 🛑 in these docs was re-checked against the live database and the current file, because several were written
BEFORE the fixes that resolved them and a stale blocker is as expensive as a missed one.

## ✅ STALE — these 🛑 blockers are RESOLVED. Do not re-do this work.
| doc claim | reality on 2026-08-30 |
|---|---|
| **F44 / step 10a: "`team_season_stats` does not exist, 3 migrations unapplied, CANNOT RUN TODAY"** | **table EXISTS + `refresh_team_season_stats` fn EXISTS** (`pg_proc` = 1). The 3 migrations were applied in DEPENDENCY order as Phase-C prereqs. Table is **0 rows** — that is F44's job, not a blocker. **F44 is RUNNABLE.** |
| **G46: "blocked — `team_season_stats` missing"** | Same. The gate is now only "F44 has RUN and populated it", not "the table must be created". |
| **F42: "`resync-build-snapshot-markets.ts:17` is hardcoded to `.env.local`, will silently write STAGING"** | **FIXED.** The file header now documents the old defect and it is env-driven (`process.env` first, env-file fallback) with a **double-keyed guard**. **F42's first half is runnable.** |
| **F41: "`rebake-twp-markets.ts` / `fix-returner-twp-hitter-market.ts` have no `--prod` flag and no ref assert"** | **FIXED.** Both now `grep -c trbvxuoliwrfowibatkm` = 1 with `--prod` handling. Still invoke them directly (not npm scripts) — that half of the note stands. |
| **D30: "`load-drs-wsb-staging.ts:53` unordered `.range()` over `players`"** | **FIXED** — `fetchAll` now takes an `orderCol` (default `id`) and orders ascending. The comment documenting why is in the file. |

## 🔴 NEW BLOCKER — `scripts/run-twp-recompute.ts` (step E35) HAS NO ENV GUARD AT ALL
`grep -c 'trbvxuoliwrfowibatkm'` = **0** and `grep -c -- '--prod'` = **0**. E35 is the **FIRST** step of Phase E and it
**sets `is_twp` + primary `position` on `players`** — a write to the identity table that every downstream precompute
keys off. `--env-file .env.production.local` writes PROD with **zero opt-in**, and passing `--prod` does nothing.
This is the SAME defect already fixed in `_run_store_no_propagate.ts` (C26), both C28 producers, and the four market
scripts — **the fifth instance of it.** ⚠ Prod `is_twp` = **137/31,467** vs staging's 253, so this step genuinely has
work to do on prod and WILL be run. **Add the standard double-keyed guard and verify the refuse path before Phase E.**

## 🔴 STILL OPEN — `backfill_park_factors_seasonal.ts` (E2) is unguarded AND staging-hardwired
`grep -c` = **0 / 0**. Prod `"Park Factors"` 2026 = **309 rows · `rg_factor` 309/309 ✅ · `rg_factor_seasonal` 0/309 ❌**
(staging 308/308). Confirms audit G13/H4: the producer has never run on prod. **Not a C28 blocker** (C28 reads
`rg_factor`, which is full) — but it must be guarded + re-pointed before E2, and F44/G46 consume park-derived values.

## 📊 PROD STATE PROBED DIRECTLY (2026-08-30) — the numbers Phase D/E/F start from
```
team_season_stats           EXISTS, 0 rows        refresh_team_season_stats()  EXISTS
team_war_snapshots.team_drs COLUMN ABSENT  ← the Phase D hard blocker (D29b)
"Park Factors" 2026         309 · rg_factor 309 ✅ · rg_factor_seasonal 0 ❌
"Hitter Master"   2026 D1   5,340 · d_war 0 · desc_owar 0 · total_desc_war 0   ← Phase D fills
"Pitching Master" 2026 D1   5,375 · drs_behind 0 · desc_pwar 0                 ← Phase D fills
players                     31,467 · is_twp 137   (staging 253)                ← E35 fills
customer_teams active       14  ✅ (NOT 18 — that is a staging number)
player_predictions 2027     200,754 rows (pre-existing; Phase E regenerates)
```
★ **`Hitter Master.d_war` = 0/5,340 is independent CONFIRMATION that the accidental `refresh_composite_war()` did NOT
touch the Masters** — it writes `player_predictions`. The runbook's F39 description is wrong; see the Phase D block.

## 🧠 LESSON — RE-PROBE BEFORE TRUSTING A 🛑 YOU WROTE YESTERDAY
Four blockers were already fixed and one brand-new one was sitting unflagged in the very next phase. A 🛑 records the
state at the moment it was written; it is **not** a live indicator. **Re-run the check, then act.** The 5-question
pre-flight (LANE · GUARD · ORDER · SILENT FALLBACK · BACKUP) has now found a real defect before **every** step it has
been applied to — C24 (legacy lane) · C26 (no guard, lying banner) · C27 (wrong order) · C28 (no guards on either
producer, no backup) · C28b (no runner at all) · Conference Stuff+ (legacy lane) · D31 (sort key) · **E35 (no guard)**.

# 📌 TWO DECISIONS LOCKED (Trevor, 2026-08-30)
## 1. STAGING CATCH-UP HAPPENS **AFTER** THE PROD PUSH — and it will be run **THROUGH TRACK B**
Staging is missing C24 / C26 / C27 / C28 / C28b / C29. It is **deliberately** not being caught up first.
**Consequence to hold onto:** for the columns prod has and staging does not (`pitcher_ev90`, `pitcher_exit_velo`,
`pitcher_in_zone_pct`, `pitcher_iz_whiff_pct`, and the conference `*_plus` set), **staging is NOT a valid reference**.
Do not treat a prod↔staging mismatch as a prod defect without first checking which environment is behind.
★ **The catch-up is not a manual re-run of six scripts — it is the FIRST REAL EXERCISE OF TRACK B.**
## 2. `rg_factor_seasonal` **MUST** BE FILLED (not deferred) → E2 is a required step. See the E2 block.
## ★ WHY TRACK B IS THE POINT — the target operating model
**Track B is ONE edge function that runs ONCE PER DAY and performs the entire upload + store chain.** Everything in
this push that is a hand-run script becomes a stage inside that single daily run. That is why **every finding, lane,
order dependency, silent fallback and gate in these documents gets logged into
`docs/PIPELINE_pitch_log_to_projections.md` in full detail** — that document is the SPECIFICATION Track B is built
from, and the prod push is the dress rehearsal for it.
**Every defect found in this push is a requirement for Track B**, because a daily automated run has no human to
notice that a column is "populated but stale":
- the value/input LANE SPLIT (pitch_log vs legacy PSP-I) — 3 occurrences, all invisible to count checks
- ORDER dependencies where a stale input yields wrong numbers with **NO error**: C27→C26 · C29→C28 · D31→D32 ·
  E35→precomputes · **E2→`derive_conf_opr_htp`** (found 2026-08-30)
- SILENT FALLBACKS: hardcoded defaults for missing baselines, `num(NULL) → 0`, a version filter that matches 0 rows
  and exits 0
- destructive delete+reinsert stages that need a backup and a **row-level** (not count-level) gate
**Rule for Track B: a stage is not "done" because it ran. It is done when a stage-specific VALUE gate passes.**

# 🅴2 PARK FACTORS SEASONAL — DECISION: **MUST BE FILLED** (Trevor, 2026-08-30). And it FORCES A C28 RE-RUN.
`rg_factor_seasonal` is **0/309 on prod** vs 308/308 on staging. Trevor: **"rg factor seasonal 100% has to be filled."**
So E2 is a REQUIRED step, not the deferral the docs assumed. Investigating it turned up **four** things, one of which
is an ordering dependency that no doc records.

## 🔴 1. THE ORDERING BOMB — **E2 INVALIDATES C28's OPR/HTP OUTPUTS. `derive_conf_opr_htp` MUST BE RE-RUN AFTER E2.**
`backfill_park_factors_seasonal.ts:274` writes the **MAIN** factor columns too, not just `*_seasonal`:
`avg_factor, obp_factor, iso_factor, rg_factor, whip_factor, hr9_factor` + the lhb/rhb set. For the CURRENT season it
sets them to the **3-YEAR ROLLING** mean (2024/25/26), not the single season (`:267` `isCur ? rolling : sf`).
**`derive_conf_opr_htp.ts:10` reads `"Park Factors".rg_factor`** — and C28 step 3 ALREADY RAN on prod against the
*current* `rg_factor`, producing `run_env_factor` **30/30 (avg 101.879)** and `hitter_talent_plus` **30/30**.
E2 changes `rg_factor` underneath them ⇒ **both silently go stale**, and `HTP = OPR + 1.25·(Stuff+−100) + 0.75·park`
is the **competition-translation lever** — the exact same blast radius as the Conference Stuff+ catch.
★ **THEREFORE: after E2 applies, RE-RUN `derive_conf_opr_htp.ts --apply --prod` (C28 step 3).** It is idempotent and
cheap. A count check will show 30/30 and PASS either way — this is the **fourth** "populated but not fresh" trap of
this push. Log the BEFORE/AFTER `run_env_factor` values and require them to CHANGE.
(⚠ If E2 is instead run BEFORE C28 in some future ordering, C28 step 3 simply consumes the new value and no re-run is
needed. The rule is: **`derive_conf_opr_htp` must be the LAST thing to touch park-derived conference columns.**)

## 🔴 2. IT IS A DESTRUCTIVE DELETE + REINSERT OF THREE WHOLE SEASONS — not an upsert
`:285-288` `await sb.from("Park Factors").delete().eq("season", y)` for **each of 2024, 2025, 2026**, THEN inserts
(`:291`). There is **no upsert and no transaction** — a failure between the delete and the insert leaves Park Factors
**EMPTY for those seasons**, which takes conference HTP and every park-adjusted projection with it.
**PROD TODAY:** `2025 → 306 rows` · `2026 → 309 rows` · **no 2024 rows at all** (E2 CREATES the 2024 season on prod).
✅ **`_parkfactors_backup` exists on prod = 615 rows = exactly 306 + 309.** Restore point confirmed complete.
⚠ **ROW-COUNT GATE:** the reinsert only writes teams present in the CSVs. Prod 2026 has **309** rows and staging has
**308** — so at least one prod team may NOT come back. **Diff the team list BEFORE/AFTER and account for every dropped
row by name** before accepting the run. Do not gate on "it inserted lots of rows."

## 🔴 3. HARDCODED TO STAGING — `--env-file` CANNOT REDIRECT IT (same defect class as the old F42)
`:37` `const url = "https://slrxowawbijbjrkozqlj.supabase.co";` — a **literal staging URL** — and `:38-39` reads the
**literal string `.env.local`** for the service key. `grep -c 'trbvxuoliwrfowibatkm'` = **0**, `grep -c -- '--prod'` = **0**.
Running it "on prod" today would **silently rewrite STAGING's Park Factors and report success.**
**FIX BEFORE RUNNING:** make it env-driven (`process.env` first, env-file fallback) + the standard double-keyed guard,
copying the pattern now in `scripts/resync-build-snapshot-markets.ts`. Verify BOTH refuse paths.

## ⚠ 4. MACHINE-LOCAL FIXTURES — like Phase D, this can only be run from this machine
`:33` `ROOT = "/Users/danielleogonowski/RSTR IQ Data/park-factors"` — outside the repo, not in git.
✅ **VERIFIED PRESENT: `2024/`, `2025/`, `2026/`, 6 CSVs each** (combined/lhb/rhb × hitter/pitcher).

## ▶️ E2 ORDERED SEQUENCE
```
E2a  Add the double-keyed guard + env-driven URL/key to backfill_park_factors_seasonal.ts. Verify both refuse paths.
E2b  DRY RUN on prod. It prints "2026 rolling vs existing" mean|Δ| / max|Δ| / worst-8 per metric (:247-254).
     ★ READ THAT DIFF — it is telling you exactly how much C28's run_env_factor is about to move.
     Record the 2026 team list; diff vs the 309 prod rows and name every team that would not be reinserted.
E2c  Confirm _parkfactors_backup = 615 (done ✅). APPLY.
     GATE: rg_factor_seasonal 309/309 (was 0/309) · rg_factor still 309/309 · 2024 season now present ·
           no team silently dropped.
E2d  ★ RE-RUN `derive_conf_opr_htp.ts --apply --prod` — C28 step 3. REQUIRED, see §1.
     GATE: run_env_factor CHANGES from avg 101.879 (30/30 before and after — the count proves nothing).
```

# 🔬 ORDER AUDIT — TOPIC vs DATA DEPENDENCY → `docs/AUDIT_dependency_order_vs_topic_order_2026_08_30.md`
**The phase order in this document is organized by TOPIC (schema / config / producers / defense / precomputes /
re-bakes), NOT by what-feeds-what. A full read/write graph audit of every remaining step found TWO STRUCTURAL DEFECTS:**
1. 🔴 **PHASE E READS A TABLE PHASE F CREATES.** `precompute-transfer-projections.ts:225` and `precompute-pitchers.ts:279`
   read `team_season_stats.faced_stuff_plus` / `.faced_htp`, whose ONLY producer is **F44**, the LAST step of Phase F.
   Prod's table is **0 rows**. The read **discards `error` and coerces to `[]`**, so the faced-competition adjustment
   for Independent programs **silently does not apply** — the only trace is a log line reading `0 … rows`.
   The docs gate **G46** on this table but never carried that gate back to E38. **→ F44 MUST MOVE BEFORE PHASE E.**
   ✅ No cycle: `refresh_team_season_stats` does NOT read `player_predictions` (grep = 0), so a clean total order exists.
2. 🔴 **A REQUIRED STEP IS IN NO RUNBOOK.** `refresh_team_season_stats.sql:143` divides by `sum(regular_season_ip)`,
   which is **0/5,375 on prod** ⇒ `nullif(...,0)` → **NULL** ⇒ every regular-season rate in `team_season_stats` lands
   NULL, silently. Producer = `scripts/lock-season-cli.ts` ("Lock Regular Season 2026"), which appears as a numbered
   step **nowhere**. **→ ADD AS `D33b`, before F44.**
**CORRECTED ORDER (derived from the graph, not the topic):**
`D29b → D30 → D31 → D32 → ★D33b lock-season → E2 → ★re-run derive_conf_opr_htp → ★F44 → E35 → E36 → E37 → E38 →
F39 → F40 → F41 → F42 → F42b → F43 → G46`
**Edges the topic order got RIGHT (do not churn):** F39-after-E · F40→F41→F42 · E35-before-precomputes · C27→C26→C28 ·
G46 last. Full evidence, per-step reads/writes, and the three Track B requirements are in the audit doc.

# 🔬 ORDER AUDIT PART 2 — PHASES A, B, C (THE WORK ALREADY DONE). Was any of it run out of order, or since invalidated?
Trevor: *"you audited everything we already did as well included in that correct?"* — **Initially NO. Now yes.**
Part 1 audited only the REMAINING steps. This part runs the same read/write graph over the COMPLETED work and asks the
question that actually matters: **is anything we already ran now STALE because of something else we ran after it, or
something we are about to run?** Verified against prod, not reasoned.

## ✅ RESULT: EVERY COMPLETED STEP IS STILL VALID. Nothing already run needs redoing. Two near-misses, both clean.
| edge | verified | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| chain 1→2 | `derive_stuff_plus_pop_baseline` reads `_reclass_pf` + `pitch_log_corrected` (reclassifier outputs) | ✅ correct order |
| chain 2→3 | `compute_pitch_log_stuff_plus` reads `pitcher_stuff_plus_ncaa` (chain 2) | ✅ |
| chain 3→4 | aggregation reads scored `pitch_log` | ✅ |
| chain 4→**C27** | `computeNcaaAverages:347` reads **`pitch_log_pitcher_totals`** and weights Stuff+ by `stuff_plus_data_pitches` (`:24-26` — the LIVE pitch_log lane, explicitly NOT the legacy PSP-I) | ✅ correct lane AND correct order |
| C24→C28-4 | Conference Stuff+ = `Σ(Pitching Master.stuff_plus × trackman_pitches)/Σ(trackman_pitches)` — needs C24's `trackman_pitches` AND the chain-5 `stuff_plus` | ✅ both were run first |
| C27→C26 | `computeAndStoreScores` reads `ncaa_averages`, silently defaults if absent | ✅ C27 ran first (this was CORRECTED earlier this push) |
| C29→C28 | both C28 producers filter on `division` | ✅ C29 ran first |
| C26→C28-2 | `compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus` reads `"Pitching Master"` + `ncaa_averages` | ✅ |
| C27→C28b | `conferenceScoutingAverages` reads `ncaa_averages`, errors loudly if missing | ✅ |

## ✅ NEAR-MISS 1 — **PHASE D DOES NOT INVALIDATE PHASE C.** (Checked because it easily could have.)
If `computeNcaaAverages` (C27) or `computeAndStoreScores` (C26) read any `desc_*` / WAR column, then Phase D writing
those columns would make C26/C27 stale and force a re-run of the whole back half of Phase C.
**Grepped both for `desc_owar|desc_pwar|d_war|bsr_war|total_desc_war|drs_behind|regular_season_*`: ZERO hits.**
→ **Phase D and Phase C touch DISJOINT Master columns. No re-run needed.** ✅

## ✅ NEAR-MISS 2 — **D31 DOES NOT CLOBBER C26's POWER RATINGS.** (The dangerous shape would be a full-row upsert.)
`populate_descriptive_war.mjs:156` is **`.update(cols).eq("source_player_id",…).eq("Season",…)`** — a **PARTIAL column
UPDATE**, not `.upsert()` of a whole row. It writes only its own `desc_*` columns and leaves C26's
`ba/obp/iso_power_rating`, `pRV+`, `era⁺…` untouched. ✅
⚠ **BUT NOTE ITS ERROR HANDLING:** `:157` is `if (error) { console.error(…) }` — errors are **printed, not counted,
and not fatal**, inside a 10,715-update loop that then **exits 0**. Another "validate by CONTENT, not exit code" case.
**Gate D31 on the non-null counts, never on the exit code.**

## ✅ NEAR-MISS 3 — **C27 DID NOT OVERWRITE PHASE B's TUNED CONFIG.** (C27 upserts `model_config`, so this was real.)
`computeNcaaAverages:428` upserts `model_config` `onConflict: model_type,season,config_key` — it would silently
overwrite any Phase-B key it shares. **Verified on prod AFTER C27 ran:** `nil_tier_sec = 4.0` ✅ ·
`r_obp_std_pr = 31.89504` ✅ · **220 keys** (unchanged) ✅ · **6** `_sd_good`/`_sd_bad` keys with **0** still reset to 0 ✅.
C27's keys (`p_ncaa_avg_*` / `p_sd_*`, e.g. `p_ncaa_avg_stuff_plus = 100.0141`) are **DISJOINT** from Phase B's tuned
weights. **Phase B survived C27 intact.** ✅

## 🛑 DEFECT FOUND IN THE ALREADY-DONE WORK — THE VERIFICATION GATE ITSELF USES KEY NAMES THAT DO NOT EXIST
The documented Phase-B gate reads `obp_std_pr=31.89504, whip_pr_sd=37.19844, owar_repl_600`. **None of those key names
exist on prod.** The gate query returns **ZERO ROWS** — and a zero-row result reads as *"the config is missing"*, which
would send the next person chasing a non-existent Phase-B failure.
**REAL KEY NAMES (verified on prod, values all CORRECT):**
`r_obp_std_pr` = **31.89504** · `t_obp_std_pr` = **31.89504** · `p_whip_pr_sd` = **37.19844** ·
`owar_replacement_runs_per_600` = **21.22** · `pwar_replacement_runs_per_9` = **1.92** · `nil_tier_sec` = **4.0**.
✅ **Corrected INLINE** at the gate in `PROD_PUSH_STEPS` and at RUNBOOK rows 1–2 (which additionally carried the
superseded VALUES 37.13 / 32.41).

## 🧠 THE PATTERN ACROSS BOTH AUDIT PARTS
Part 1 (remaining steps) found **2 structural defects**. Part 2 (completed steps) found **0 invalidations but 1 broken
gate** — the verification query itself was wrong, which is the most expensive kind of error because it makes correct
work *look* broken and broken work *look* fine.
→ **Audit the GATES with the same rigour as the steps.** A gate that cannot fail, or cannot pass, is not a gate.

# ✅ STEP 0 COMPLETE (2026-08-30) — five pre-flight code fixes, all refuse paths VERIFIED. No DB writes.
| # | fix | verification |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`run-twp-recompute.ts` (E35) — double-keyed guard ADDED.** It had NONE (`grep -c` = 0 both ways) and writes `players.is_twp` + primary `position`, the identity table every precompute keys off. | `✗ URL is PROD but --prod was not passed — refusing.` ✅ · `✗ --prod passed but URL is not prod — refusing.` ✅ |
| 2 | **`backfill_park_factors_seasonal.ts` (E2) — env-driven + guard.** Was HARDCODED to a literal staging URL and a literal `.env.local` key read, so `--env-file` could not redirect it and a "prod run" would have silently rewritten STAGING. Header now documents the destructive delete+reinsert, the `rg_factor` rewrite that forces a `derive_conf_opr_htp` re-run, and the team-by-team (not row-count) gate. | both refuse paths ✅ · staging allow path ✅ `[env] STAGING/other mode=DRY-RUN` |
| 3 | **`populate_descriptive_war.mjs` (D31) — sort key now the FULL PK.** `player_id` alone is not unique on `player_season_defense` (9,268 distinct / 13,454 rows over 14 pages ⇒ ~4,186 rows in ambiguous order). Now `(player_id, season, position)` and `(player_id, season)`, mirroring `computeNcaaAverages` `PAGINATION_KEYS`. | parses + runs ✅ |
| 4 | **`populate_descriptive_war.mjs` — write errors now COUNTED and FATAL.** They were printed but not counted inside a ~10,715-update loop that then **exited 0**, so a partial write looked identical to a clean run. Now per-table `written/failed` summary + `exit 1`. | ✅ |
| 5 | **`scripts/load-drs-wsb-prod.ts` DELETED.** Stale duplicate: never got the ordered-pagination fix (`:38` bare `.range()`), no `--dry-run`, prod-named, one tab-completion from the correct script. | removed ✅ |

**D31 DRY-RUN ON PROD (read-only) — CONFIRMS THE BLOCKER IS REAL AND SAFE:**
```
target: 🔴 PROD [dry-run — pass --commit to write]
constants: RPW 13.1 E2T 1.1373 replRA9 8.83 | wOBA lg 0.3782 scale 0.947 repl 1.62/600
team_war_snapshots column team_war_snapshots.team_drs does not exist
```
✅ constants correct · ✅ exits **before any write** · ✅ the only thing standing between us and Phase D is **D29b**.

## ▶️ NEXT ACTION — **D29b NEEDS TREVOR'S EXPLICIT "prod, now?"** (it is DDL + a data write on prod)
PASTE `scripts/sql/team_drs_store.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor. ⛔ **never `--linked`** (config.toml names a third
ref `kfkuhdmpchxyffmnowgj`). Idempotent (`:2` is `add column if not exists`).
**GATE:** `select count(*) filter (where team_drs is not null), round(sum(team_drs)::numeric,2) from
team_war_snapshots where season = 2026;` → **EXPECT `308` and `~-0.01`.** Then tick `PROD_MIGRATIONS_TODO.md:234`.
