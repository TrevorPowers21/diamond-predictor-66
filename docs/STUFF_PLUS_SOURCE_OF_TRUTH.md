**Read this before touching anything Stuff+.** It supersedes the Stuff+ sections of every earlier handoff, audit, and
agent-learnings doc. Where an older doc disagrees with this file, **this file wins** and the older doc is wrong.

Verified empirically on staging 2026-08-29 (not inferred from docs — the earlier docs were written during a period of
confusion and contained wrong conclusions).

## 1. THE TWO LANES

### ★ TOP DOG — the pitch_log lane (LIVE, correct, the number coaches see)
```
pitch_log (per-pitch, venue-corrected)
  → pitch_type_reclassified          [v2 classifier, stamped v2-ranges-2026-08-28 (staging); prod still on OLD CASE labels]
  → compute_pitch_log_stuff_plus.ts  [normalizes hb → armHB, scores per pitch]
  → pitch_log.stuff_plus
  → aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts
  → pitch_log_pitcher_totals / pitch_log_pitcher_by_pitch_type  (stuff_plus_sum / data_pitches)
  → DISPLAYS: Season Stats (PitchLogSection) + PitcherProfile arsenal table
```
**Convention: armHB throughout.** Rows are normalized (`RHP hb / LHP −hb`) in `compute_pitch_log_stuff_plus.ts` (~line 200),
the pop baseline `pitcher_stuff_plus_ncaa` is armHB-derived (VERIFIED: CH R +14.93 / L +14.87, SL R −6.49 / L −6.83 — same
sign both hands), and the 9 equations are "folded" to expect armHB. **Fully self-consistent. No bug.**

### ⚠ LEGACY — the CSV / PSP-I lane (superseded; fallback only)
```
TruMedia CSV → importStuffPlusInputsCsv → pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs   [stores RAW hb]
  → runStuffPlusPipeline (in stuffPlusEngine.ts)   ✗ passes RAW hb to armHB-expecting equations
  → rollupStuffPlusToMaster → "Pitching Master".stuff_plus            ✗ stale / wrong / nothing reads it for 2026
```
Only still used for: **prior seasons (≤2025)** and **JUCO** (no JUCO pitch logs exist). For 2026 D1 it is **not read**:
`PitcherProfile.tsx:664` ("PITCH_LOG Switch #1, 2026-06-23") skips PSP-I entirely for 2026 when pitch_log has rows.

---

## 2. THE LATENT BUG IN THE LEGACY LANE (do not "fix" the live lane for this)
Commit `e5dec2f` (2026-08-17) removed the `hbSign = hand === "L" ? -1 : 1` multiplier from all 7 HB-signed equations,
because the NEW pitch-log caller normalizes to armHB itself. The OLD aggregate caller (`runStuffPlusPipeline`) was never
updated and still passes RAW hb. **Consequence if run: left-handers are scored backwards** (a bigger lefty sweeper is
penalized). PROVEN: current code gives Slider R −0.979 / L −0.976 (same sign = broken); the stored pre-Aug-17 data gives
R −0.859 / L +0.883 (mirrored = correct).
- **NOT live.** Nothing has run that path since Aug 17, so no displayed number is affected. `e5dec2f` is only on
  `feature/war-recalibration`, not main.
- **Fix when/if the legacy lane is revived:** normalize raw→armHB in memory inside `runStuffPlusPipeline` (mirroring the
  pitch-log path). **Do NOT rewrite the stored `hb` column** — it is raw by design, displayed by the UI, and written raw
  by the CSV importer. armHB is a COMPUTE convention, not a STORAGE convention.

---

## 3. THREE DIFFERENT "Stuff+" NUMBERS EXIST — know which you're looking at
Measured for Dylan Volantis (`source_player_id 1979617275`), staging 2026:

| value | source | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **107.62** | `pitch_log_pitcher_totals[all]` | ★ **THE REAL ONE** — what displays |
| 104.93 | `"Pitching Master".stuff_plus` | stale old master upload, never updated — ignore |
| 115.2 | pitch-weighted rollup of `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs` | legacy lane, not displayed |

If a doc or script quotes a Stuff+ number, confirm which of these it means before trusting it.

---

## 4. CLASSIFIER: what is real
- **v2 is the classifier. `src/savant/lib/stuffPlusClassifierV2.ts` is the SINGLE source**, driven by
  `scripts/reclassify_prod.ts` (which also materializes `_reclass_pf`). `scripts/reclassify_v2.ts` is a VALIDATION
  HARNESS only and no longer carries its own copy — that duplication is why earlier accuracy numbers drifted.
- **FINAL ACCURACY: 1,904,808 / 2,000,674 = 95.2% per-pitch · arsenal-mix 95.3% · needs_review 8.1%** on the full
  population (§11.13, with §4.5 running BEFORE the step-4 backfill).
  ⚠ **SUPERSEDED — never quote as current:** 92.6% / 90.5% (measured on the deleted duplicate copy), 94.3%
  (pre-gyro-fix), 95.1% (§4.5 after the fold), and any "projected ~95.3-95.4%".
- The cross-arm-side errors previously cited here (`Gyro Slider → Change-up`, `Slider → Change-up`) are **FIXED** by the
  offspeed `armHB >= 5` floor and the §4.5 gyro floor. See `docs/STUFF_PLUS_EXACT_VALUES.md` §11.
- **The ANCHOR classifier** produced staging's previous labels (**2,005,666 rows** stamped `v1-anchor-2026-08-17`). Its
  source code was scratchpad-only and is **permanently lost** — it can never be re-run, on new data or on prod. Its
  output survives ONLY as staging `_reclass_result` (2,000,674 rows), which is the historical regression baseline.
- **`legacy_breakingBallReclassification.ts`** (renamed from `breakingBallReclassification.ts`) writes `rstr_pitch_class`
  on PSP-I and **has never touched `pitch_log`**. It is NOT the anchor classifier. Conflating the two cost a full day
  (2026-08-28/29).
- **★ ON OVERWRITING STAGING'S LABELS — FINAL (Trevor): YES, OVERWRITE. Standardize on v2 in BOTH environments.**
  The coherence partition (234 pitchers, 1,188 decidable disputes, run after all three fixes) measured **v2 closer
  44.1% / anchor closer 55.9%** — the anchor wins the residual, and the "maybe v2 is right" hypothesis was REJECTED by
  measurement. That measurement stands. But its cost is only ≈11,700 pitches ≈ **0.6% of the population**, and it is
  bought from a classifier with NO source code. v2 is committed, versioned, re-runnable, and is what Track B needs on
  every ingest; one vocabulary (`4S FB`, not `4-Seam Fastball`) + a `classification_version` stamp in BOTH envs beats a
  0.6pp edge on an unreproducible process. **Preserve `_reclass_result`.**
  ⚠ Limitation on the record: the partition does NOT cover the Gyro↔Slider pair (23,048 pitches, the largest residual) —
  the centroid basis was missing after the §4.5 fix. Whether the −3 floor over-calls gyro relative to physical truth is
  STILL UNMEASURED; do not claim it either way.
  ⚠ Methodological note that remains true: "agreement with the anchor" is SIMILARITY TO THE ANCHOR, not accuracy — the
  anchor is a previous classifier's output, not truth.
- v2's confirmed purpose: the committed, **re-runnable forward classifier** for PROD (whose pitch_log still carries only
  the OLD per-pitch CASE labels) and for Track B on every ingest.

## 5. COVERAGE FACTS (measured, not assumed)
- `pitch_log` is **D1-only**. `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs` covers **7,012** pitchers; pitch_log covers **5,303** (all D1).
- The **1,709** pitchers with PSP-I rows but no pitch_log are **1,627 NJCAA_D1 + 81 D1 + 1 D2**.
  → Deriving inputs from pitch_log alone silently drops all JUCO. JUCO stays CSV-derived (scored vs D1 baselines).
- PSP-I and pitch_log are different pitch populations even for matched pitchers (~11.4 fewer pitches/row in pitch_log).

---

## 6. FILE MAP — top dog vs legacy
**★ TOP DOG (pitch_log lane):** `scripts/compute_pitch_log_stuff_plus.ts` · `scripts/aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts` ·
`src/savant/lib/stuffPlusClassifierV2.ts` · `scripts/reclassify_prod.ts` (prod label writer) ·
`pitch_log_pitcher_totals` / `_by_pitch_type` tables · `src/savant/hooks/usePitchLog*` · `src/savant/components/PitchLogSection.tsx`.

**⚠ LEGACY (CSV/PSP-I lane — fallback for ≤2025 + JUCO):** `legacy_breakingBallReclassification.ts` (renamed) ·
`runStuffPlusPipeline` (in `stuffPlusEngine.ts`) · `legacy_rollupStuffPlusToMaster.ts` · `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs` ·
`"Pitching Master".stuff_plus` · `scripts/recompute-stuff-plus.ts` · `scripts/recompute-stuff-scoped.ts`.
⛔ The legacy lane is **gated out of `npm run import:prod`** (`scripts/import-csvs/runner.ts`) and the npm
`recompute-stuff:prod` / `recompute-stuff-scoped:prod` scripts were **DELETED** — a routine TruMedia import can no
longer run it and score left-handers backwards.

**SHARED (do not label either way):** the 9 scoring equations + `calculateStuffPlus` in `stuffPlusEngine.ts`, and the
`pitcher_stuff_plus_ncaa` pop baseline — both lanes use these. Equations expect **armHB**.

**DELETED (were dead, zero importers):** `ReclassificationRunner.tsx`, `StuffPlusRunner.tsx`,
`StuffPlusRollupRunner.tsx`, `scripts/_reclass_rollout.ts`, `scripts/reclassify_pitch_log.ts`,
`scripts/_run_reclassify_bare.ts`, `scripts/_run_reclassify_chunked.ts` (+ their npm scripts).

**SAVANT guardrail:** `src/savant/pages/*` deleted (the scrubbed feature). `src/savant/components|hooks|lib` are
**LOAD-BEARING** for the live Season Stats display — do NOT delete.

---

## 7. TRACK B (target) — one chain, pitch_log as source of truth
Ingest pitch_log (weekly/biweekly, local folder) → classify (v2) → derive baseline → score per pitch → aggregate to
totals/by_pitch_type → power ratings → conference baselines → projections. Master-sheet uploads come later as a CHECK and
to override only what pitch_log cannot produce (e.g. AVG/SB). Numbers referenced here: `docs/STUFF_PLUS_EXACT_VALUES.md`.

---

## ★★★ THE STUFF+ CHAIN — pitch_log lane (the ONLY correct order)
Any Stuff+ step that routes through `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs` → `runStuffPlusPipeline` →
`legacy_rollupStuffPlusToMaster` → `"Pitching Master".stuff_plus` is the **LEGACY lane** and is WRONG for 2026. It
revives the latent raw-HB bug (`e5dec2f` removed `hbSign`; PSP-I still stores RAW hb ⇒ left-handers scored backwards)
and writes numbers nothing displays. **Never run it for 2026.**

1. **Reclassify** → `pitch_log.pitch_type_reclassified` + `classification_version` + `needs_review`
   `scripts/reclassify_prod.ts` (v2 classifier; `--dry-run` first, then `--go` with PGURI + explicit "prod, now?";
   `--target=staging` for staging). Also MATERIALIZES `_reclass_pf` as a by-product — the scorer hard-depends on it.
2. **Re-derive the pop baseline** → `pitcher_stuff_plus_ncaa` (per pitch_type × hand, **armHB**, D1-only).
   ⚠ MANDATORY, not optional: the §4.5 gyro fix moves 6-8% of ALL breaking-ball volume Slider→Gyro Slider, so every
   mix-dependent artifact is invalid until regenerated. The deriver ABORTS before writing if the armHB sign check fails.
3. **Score per pitch** → `pitch_log.stuff_plus` — `scripts/compute_pitch_log_stuff_plus.ts`
   🛑 **MUST READ BEFORE RUNNING THIS STEP:** the version filter is now parameterized (`--class-version=`, defaulting to
   the v2 stamp) — it used to be hard-coded to `v1-anchor-2026-08-17`, which silently matched 0 rows and left NEW LABELS
   + OLD SCORES. This step is idempotent but does **NOT** resume: every attempt costs the FULL runtime (~36 min on
   staging, longer on prod) and a mid-run failure leaves v2 labels + STALE scores. Run it DETACHED with
   `caffeinate -dimsu -w <pid>`. Requires `_reclass_pf` (materialized by step 1).
   (normalizes hb→armHB itself; recenters each (pitch_type × hand) bucket to mean 100)
4. **Aggregate** → `pitch_log_pitcher_totals` / `pitch_log_hitter_totals` / `*_by_pitch_type`
   `scripts/aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts --apply` (also calls `populate_hitter_run_values(season)`)
   🛑 **MUST READ BEFORE RUNNING THIS STEP → see "STEP 4 — SOLVED: USE `--direct`" below.** On PROD you MUST run ALL of
   step 4 with `--direct` (the HTTP gateway cuts at ~125s; `vs_top_hitters` needs 253s on staging, longer on prod, and a
   failure HALTS the dimensions after it). Validate by CONTENT + FRESHNESS — never by exit code or row count.
5. **Marry onto the Masters** → `scripts/derive_masters_from_pitchlog.ts --apply`
   (its `readAll` pagination is now `.order(PK)`-ed — unordered `.range()` over ~2.5M rows silently dropped/duped).
6. Then continue the runbook: C23–C29 → Phase D (dWAR) → E (precomputes) → F (re-bakes) → G (edge fn) → H (drops).

**INVARIANTS**
- ⚠ A label change invalidates every downstream number. Steps 1→5 must complete in the SAME working session;
  never leave an environment with new labels and old `stuff_plus`.
- `hb` is stored RAW everywhere and displayed raw. armHB is a COMPUTE convention only — normalize in memory.
  NEVER rewrite the stored `hb` column.
- One consistent label vocabulary: `4S FB` (not `4-Seam Fastball`) + a `classification_version` stamp on every row.
- Full detail + evidence: `docs/STUFF_PLUS_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`; exact numbers: `docs/STUFF_PLUS_EXACT_VALUES.md` §11.

## ★★★ TRACK B — STUFF+ STAGE, LOCKED SPEC. Supersedes any earlier Stuff+ description in this file.
Track B = ONE function on pitch-log ingest (weekly/biweekly, local folder watch). Master-sheet uploads come LATER as a
CHECK + to override only what pitch_log cannot produce (e.g. AVG/SB). **pitch_log is the SOURCE OF TRUTH.**
The Stuff+ stage is exactly steps 1→5 of "THE STUFF+ CHAIN" above, in one run — a label change invalidates every number
below it. Then: power ratings → conference baselines → projections → market/NIL.

**⛔ WHAT TRACK B MUST NEVER DO**
- NEVER route Stuff+ through the LEGACY lane: `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs` → `runStuffPlusPipeline` →
  `legacy_rollupStuffPlusToMaster` → `"Pitching Master".stuff_plus`. Nothing reads it for 2026 and it carries the latent
  raw-HB bug (`e5dec2f` removed `hbSign`; PSP-I stores RAW hb ⇒ left-handers scored BACKWARDS).
- NEVER call `legacy_breakingBallReclassification` (v1, renamed from `breakingBallReclassification.ts`). It writes
  `rstr_pitch_class` on PSP-I, has never touched `pitch_log`, and is NOT the anchor classifier. Conflating the two cost a
  full day (2026-08-28/29).
- NEVER rewrite the stored `hb` column to armHB. `hb` is RAW by design (the UI displays it; the CSV importer writes it
  raw). armHB is a COMPUTE convention — normalize in memory only.
- NEVER leave new labels with stale scores. Steps 1→5 are one transaction-of-work.

**LANE COVERAGE (measured):** `pitch_log` is **D1-only** — 5,303 pitchers. PSP-I covers 7,012; the 1,709 difference is
**1,627 NJCAA_D1 + 81 D1 + 1 D2**. → **JUCO has no pitch logs and stays CSV-derived** (scored vs D1 baselines). Track B's
pitch_log chain covers D1 only; do not let it silently drop JUCO. JUCO process is being restarted separately.

---

## ★★★ STUFF+ v2 CLASSIFIER — FINAL STATE + CONCLUSIONS (2026-08-30). Numbers: `docs/STUFF_PLUS_EXACT_VALUES.md` §11.
**SINGLE SOURCE:** `src/savant/lib/stuffPlusClassifierV2.ts`. `scripts/reclassify_v2.ts` is a VALIDATION HARNESS only —
its duplicate copy of the classifier was DELETED (that duplication is exactly why earlier numbers drifted).

**FINAL ACCURACY — full population, all 4,804 pitchers / 2,000,674 pitches of `_reclass_result`:**
**1,904,808 / 2,000,674 = 95.2% per-pitch · arsenal-mix 95.3% · needs_review 8.1%** (§11.13 — with §4.5 running BEFORE
the step-4 backfill). ⚠ **SUPERSEDED, never quote as current:** 92.6% (measured on the deleted duplicate copy),
94.3% (pre-gyro-fix), 95.1% (§4.5 running after the fold), "~85%" (the abandoned Tier-2 reconstruction), and any
"projected ~95.3-95.4%".

**THREE FIXES SHIPPED (all measured, none guessed):**
1. **Offspeed armHB floor** `armhb > 0` → **`armhb >= 5`**. Gyro armHB p99=4.7 vs offspeed p1=5.3 — a clean empty gap.
   Killed `Gyro→Change-up` (338 losses) and `Cutter→Change-up` (29) outright.
2. **Fastball-family MERGE GUARD** — never merge clusters whose fastball-family seeds (`4S FB`/`Sinker`/`FBSTRIP`)
   differ. Merge was swallowing the FBSTRIP cluster before it could be resolved; **>60% of all 4S↔Sinker errors** were
   merged FBSTRIP clusters. 91.69% → 93.01%; 4S↔Sinker errors 2,830 → 1,676 (−41%). Also preserves genuine
   two-fastball arms (14ivb/8hb vs 8ivb/14hb at equal velo stay SEPARATE; 14/8 vs 13/9 correctly merge).
3. **§4.5 gyro/slider cluster-centroid floor** `GYRO_ARMHB_FLOOR = -3`, applied **BEFORE the step-4 backfill** (and
   therefore before `tiebreak()`). `Gyro→Slider` 1,675→471 / 1,788→508; `Gyro→Cutter` 415→131 / 437→56; zero
   fastball/offspeed regression. Ordering is load-bearing and is worth the final +0.1pp over the "after the fold" build.

**TWO NEGATIVE RESULTS — do NOT rebuild these:**
- `rr > -1.7` FBSTRIP cut (made agreement WORSE: disputes 1,443 → 2,503; it was fit on a merge-corrupted population).
  `rr >= 0` stays — within noise of the 91.9% @ rr=-0.13 optimum.
- The **"arsenal rule"** (flip Slider→Gyro when the pitcher has a GY seed and no SW seed) is a **CONFOUND**, not a rule:
  sweeper-presence predicts the anchor 71.5% vs 89.1% for the cluster's own mean armHB. Implemented literally it
  **LOSES 0.97/1.26pp**. Do not rebuild it from the `_reclass_map` contingency table.
**VERIFIED ALREADY-OPTIMAL (do not touch):** Sweeper/Slider armHB −12 (1.0% error) · Gyro/Slider armHB −5.

**★ DECISION — STANDARDIZE ON v2 IN BOTH ENVIRONMENTS (Trevor, FINAL; EXACT_VALUES §11.12).**
The coherence partition (234 pitchers, 1,188 decidable disputes, run after all three fixes) measured that the ANCHOR
wins the disputed residual **55.9 / 44.1**. That measurement STANDS, and its cost is quantified: ≈11,700 pitches ≈
**0.6% of the population**. We pay it, because the anchor has **NO SOURCE CODE** (lost scratchpad) — it can never be
re-run, on new data or on prod — while v2 is committed, versioned, re-runnable, and is what Track B needs on every
ingest, with ONE vocabulary + a `classification_version` stamp in both environments.
→ **DO overwrite staging's `pitch_type_reclassified` with v2.** Any "do NOT overwrite staging's labels" guidance
(including the earlier framing in SOURCE_OF_TRUTH §4 and EXACT_VALUES §11.11) is **REVERSED and obsolete**.
→ **PRESERVE `_reclass_result`** — the sole surviving record of the anchor, and the regression baseline for every
future classifier change.
⚠ Limitation kept on the record: the coherence partition does NOT cover the Gyro↔Slider pair (23,048 pitches, the
largest residual) — centroids were unavailable after the §4.5 fix. Whether the −3 floor over-calls gyro relative to
physical truth is STILL UNMEASURED; do not claim it either way.

**⚠ DOWNSTREAM — NOT display-only.** The gyro fix moves **6-8% of ALL breaking-ball volume** Slider→Gyro Slider. Every
mix-dependent artifact MUST be regenerated after a reclass run: `pitcher_stuff_plus_ncaa` baselines, D1/regional means
+ SDs, pitch-shape percentiles. Reclassify → baseline → score → aggregate MUST complete in ONE session.

**PROD STATUS:** prod pitch_log is on the OLD per-pitch CASE labels (`"4-Seam Fastball"` naming, ~2,176,888 labeled of
~2,575,996, NO `classification_version` stamp, `needs_review` all null) — **v2 has NEVER written to prod**; the prior
prod work was a read-only dry run. v2 vs prod's existing labels = **70.9% agreement (v2 would change 584,130 pitches =
29.1%)**, and v2 is far closer to the validated set (distribution deviation from anchor **38.7 → 21.6**), correcting
prod's Cutter 10.3%→3.7% (anchor 2.4%) and Splitter 0.7%→2.1% (anchor 2.2%). Prod run is GATED on PGURI + an explicit
"prod, now?" and MUST be followed immediately by the rest of the Stuff+ chain.

---

# STAGE 0 — PRE-PROD BLOCKER STATUS (updated 2026-08-30): **1 OPEN, THE REST RESOLVED**
Prod's **DATA is ready** — 100.00% of prod's `is_data=true` rows (~1,906,398) are v2-classifiable, venue corrections
resolve, same games/window as staging. Every blocker was CODE or SCHEMA, and all but one have shipped.

## ⛔ STILL OPEN — the only thing blocking the prod chain
1. **PROD `pitch_log_corrected` VIEW IS STALE — missing `classification_version`.** The view is `select pl.*, …` and
   Postgres FREEZES `*` at creation time, so prod's view is stuck at **94 columns** vs the base table's 99. Missing:
   `classification_version, needs_review, ab_num_in_game, pitch_num_in_game, pitch_num_in_ab, park_code,
   is_conference_game, game_string`. Running the scorer's query against prod returns
   `column pitch_log_corrected.classification_version does not exist`. Same query on staging = OK.
   ⚠ `create or replace view` will NOT fix it (new columns land mid-list) → needs **`drop view pitch_log_corrected
   cascade; create view …`** rebuilt against the current column list. **DDL — requires an explicit go, separate from the
   data-write "prod, now?".** (Reclassification itself is unaffected — `reclassify_prod.ts` doesn't read those columns.)

## ✅ RESOLVED — shipped; do NOT re-raise these as blockers
2. **Scorer version filter — RESOLVED.** It was hard-coded `.eq("classification_version","v1-anchor-2026-08-17")` while
   `reclassify_prod.ts` stamps `v2-ranges-2026-08-28`, so it silently matched 0 rows (new labels + old scores). It is now
   **parameterized (`--class-version=`, defaulting to the v2 stamp)**. *Evidence:* on staging steps 1→3 connected
   end-to-end and scored 2,015,321 rows. (This also supersedes the old checklist item "do NOT loosen the filter".)
3. **`_reclass_pf` producer — RESOLVED.** `reclassify_prod.ts` now materializes it as a by-product of `pfbVelo()`.
   *Evidence:* the staging run materialized **5,364 pitchers**, and step 2 read it back.
4. **`aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts` prod path — RESOLVED.** It now has a prod path + a `--prod` guard, plus the NEW
   `--direct` and `--only=` flags. *Evidence:* `--direct` cleared `vs_top_hitters` on staging in 253.2s.
5. **§4.5 ordering — RESOLVED.** §4.5 runs BEFORE the step-4 backfill; measured **95.2% / 95.3%** (§11.13) — strictly
   better on both metrics than the 95.1% "after the fold" ordering, so there is nothing left to measure or revert.
6. **Ordered pagination — RESOLVED.** `derive_masters_from_pitchlog.ts` `readAll` is ordered, plus two further
   ordered-pagination fixes (`backfill_trackman_pitches_pitching_master.ts`, `compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus.ts`).
7. **Legacy lane gated out of the live prod CSV path — RESOLVED.** `scripts/import-csvs/runner.ts` (= `npm run
   import:prod`, which goes DIRECT to prod) no longer runs the legacy raw-HB lane, and npm `recompute-stuff:prod` /
   `recompute-stuff-scoped:prod` were **DELETED**. A routine TruMedia import can no longer score left-handers backwards.
8. **Ledger entries — RESOLVED.** C20 park_code (2,576,146 = 100%), C21 `is_conference_game` + C22 sequence
   (2,576,146), and migration `20260828000000_pitch_log_classification_version_needs_review.sql` are all logged in
   `PROD_MIGRATIONS_TODO.md`.
9. **Staging reclassification writer — RESOLVED.** `reclassify_prod.ts --target=staging`, with a double-keyed guard
   (it refuses unless PGURI's project ref matches the named target).

## ⚠ CLAIMS THAT ARE FALSE — audits disproved them; do not treat any of these as live blockers
"A5 aggregator (pitch_log → `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs`) is missing" · "the baseline deriver is missing" ·
"the live path has a pop/row convention mismatch" · "the v2 reclassification WRITER does not exist" ·
"the classifier is only ~85% and cannot reach its gate". All verified present / correct / superseded.

## OPEN BUT NOT BLOCKING
- **C21/C22 derive-over-copy follow-up.** They were COPIED from staging (`_next_derived.ts`), not derived. Prod must be
  able to DERIVE `park_code` / `is_conference_game` / sequence going forward or **Track B breaks on the next ingest.**
- **Migration `20260829120000_gm_budget_nil_allocation_mode.sql`** — committed, **NOT yet applied to either env.**
- **Row-count populations, pinned so gates are falsifiable** (these are DIFFERENT populations, not a contradiction):
  2,576,230 = prod pitch_log total pre-dedup · 2,576,146 = park_code/is_conf/sequence filled · ~2,176,888 = prod rows
  carrying an OLD CASE label · 2,013,005 = the v2 prod DRY-RUN label count · **prod `is_data=true` ≈ 1,906,398**
  (74.01% of 2,575,996) · staging v2 classified/stamped = 2,015,321.

## GREEN — verified ready on prod (audit 2026-08-29, read-only)
v2-classifiable **100.00%** of is_data=true (~1,906,398) · venue corrections **311 rows**, ivb/hb_corrected differ from
raw in 100% of samples · release_velocity/ivb/hb/spin/rel_height/rel_side/pitcher_hand/pitcher_id/park_code/
is_conference_game/sequence/pitcher_full_name all **0.00% NULL** (extension 0.04%) · same games + window as staging
(2026-02-13 → 06-22, identical first/last uniq_pitch_id) · `pitcher_stuff_plus_ncaa` 18 D1 buckets ·
pitch_log_pitcher_totals 37,186 · hitter_totals 50,227 · by_pitch_type 161,310 / 252,464.
⚠ `Pitching Master` rollup is BEHIND staging: `trackman_pitches>0` **1,126 vs 6,458**; `stuff_plus` 5,251 vs 6,011.
⚠ `vaa` column absent on prod — NOT a blocker (100% NULL on staging; neither classifier nor scorer reads it).

# ▶️ STAGING + PROD STATE, AND THE NEXT ACTIONS (2026-08-30)

## ✅ DONE + VERIFIED ON STAGING (do NOT redo)
| step | result |
|---|---|
| 0 backup | `_v2_prechain_backup` = **2,579,655 rows** / 2,191,583 labeled / 2,014,152 scored. **DO NOT DROP until the chain is signed off.** Reverses everything via one UPDATE…FROM join on `uniq_pitch_id`. |
| 1 classify | **2,015,321** stamped `v2-ranges-2026-08-28`, needs_review **8.1%**, 101 batches, updated 1,995,321. `_reclass_pf` materialized (**5,364** pitchers) — NEW producer, first ever run, works. |
| 2 baseline | **✓ armHB SIGN CHECK PASSED ON ALL 18 BUCKETS** → upserted 18/18. The armHB convention is now PROVEN, not assumed (the deriver aborts before writing if it fails). |
| 3 score | **2,015,321 scored + recentered** (35.7 min). unscored = 0. Every (type×hand) bucket recenters to **exactly 100.0**. |
| 4 aggregate | **ALL 48 dimensions refreshed** + `populate_hitter_run_values(2026)` ✓. The 3 `vs_top_hitters` aggregations that had failed on the gateway were completed over the DIRECT pg session (`--direct`). Tables: pitcher_totals 37,575 · hitter_totals 50,633 · pitcher_by_pitch_type 186,622 · hitter_by_pitch_type 301,957 · hitter run values 6,053. |

**★ PROD-GATE TOLERANCE (pre-registered): per-pitcher Stuff+ mean 99.3 · p50 99.3 · p10 93.1 · p90 105.7 ·
4,234 pitchers.** Prod must land within tolerance of this or **ABORT**.

## ⚠ STILL OPEN ON STAGING
- **Step 5 `derive_masters_from_pitchlog.ts` — DRY RUN ONLY.** Dry run: **0 hitters / 4,675 pitchers** would change
  (of 4,772 above-gate). It has NEVER been applied on ANY environment. Review the diff before `--apply`.

## ▶️ NEXT ACTIONS, IN ORDER
1. Review + apply step 5 (Masters) on staging.
2. **PROD BLOCKER FIRST — rebuild the stale view:** prod `pitch_log_corrected` is `select pl.*` frozen at **94 of 99
   columns** and MISSING `classification_version`, so the scorer hard-fails there. Needs
   `drop view pitch_log_corrected cascade; create view …`. **DDL — needs its own explicit go, separate from "prod, now?".**
3. Apply migration `20260829120000_gm_budget_nil_allocation_mode.sql` to BOTH envs (committed, never run).
4. Prod chain: reclassify → baseline → score → aggregate (**`--direct` from the start**) → Masters. Then C23→C29,
   Phase D→H per the runbook, on the pitch_log lane.

## ⏱ PROD TIME BUDGET
Staging actuals: step 1 ≈ **75 min** (load + classify + 2M keyset UPDATE) · step 3 ≈ **36 min** · step 4 ≈ **50 min**
→ **staging total ≈ 2.5-3 h.** Prod is a SMALLER compute tier with a MORE throttled disk and its `exec_sql` already
times out on lighter queries → **budget 4-6 h for the prod Stuff+ block alone**, plus C23-C29 and Phases D-H after it.
Do it in **ONE sitting** with the machine pinned awake (`caffeinate -dimsu -w <pid>`) — steps 1→5 must not be split,
because a gap leaves prod with **v2 labels + STALE scores**.
⚠ **Step 3 does NOT resume** (it re-scores everything matching the class version), so any interruption costs the FULL
runtime again. The two-phase fix (score only `stuff_plus IS NULL`, then ALWAYS recenter across the full population) is
worth building BEFORE the prod run — the recenter must see the whole population, which is why a naive resume is wrong.

---

# ✅ STEP 4 (`aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions`) — SOLVED: USE `--direct`. (staging-proven 2026-08-30)
**ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED, not theorised.** Every aggregation in this script ran through `exec_sql` over the HTTP gateway
(`aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts:1035`), and the gateway cuts the client at ~125s — the work is LOST.
`[40/48] vs_top_hitters → pitcher_totals — FAILED after 125.3s: upstream request timeout`, **reproduced EXACTLY twice**
(same dimension, same error, same duration). That query must resolve the top-quartile hitter set (~967 IDs) and filter
~2M pitches against it. Over the **DIRECT pg session the SAME query succeeded in 253.2s** — it simply needs ~2× the
gateway's ceiling; nothing else changed. 47 of 48 dimensions run fine (~60-72s each). ⚠ The script **HALTS** on a
failure, so dimensions 41-48 never ran either — one bad dimension blocked 9.

## THE COMMANDS
Staging (single dimension):
```
npx tsx --env-file .env.local scripts/aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts --apply --direct --only=vs_top_hitters
```
**PROD — run the WHOLE of step 4 with `--direct`, not just this dimension:**
```
npx tsx --env-file .env.production.local scripts/aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts --apply --prod --direct
```
`vs_top_hitters` already needs 253s on STAGING. Prod is a smaller compute tier with a more throttled disk (expect
~8-10 min for that one dimension) and prod's `exec_sql` has ALREADY been observed timing out on lighter queries →
through the gateway it would fail on prod **100% of the time**, and the halt would block the 8 dimensions after it.
**`--direct` is NOT a staging workaround — it is the REQUIRED path on prod.**

## FLAGS ON `aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts`
- **`--direct`** (new 2026-08-30) — executes over the `PGURI` session (`statement_timeout=0`, no gateway ceiling)
  instead of `exec_sql`. Guarded: the PGURI project ref MUST match the target env or it refuses to run. Logs the path used.
- **`--only=<keys>`** (new 2026-08-30) — mirrors `--skip=`; runs ONLY the named dimension(s), so one failed dimension can
  be re-run without redoing the other 47. (Partial answer to the resumability gap.)
- **`--skip=<keys>`** (existing) — skip named dimensions.
- **`--prod`** guard + prod path (added at Stage 0).

## ⚠ THE TWO TRAPS — validate by CONTENT and FRESHNESS, never by exit code or row count
- **A failed dimension leaves STALE rows that LOOK populated.** When `vs_top_hitters` failed, `pitch_log_pitcher_totals`
  still SHOWED **5,349 rows** for that `dimension_key` — left over from a PRE-v2 run, computed from OLD labels and OLD
  Stuff+ scores. **A row-count check would have passed.** → After ANY reclassification, verify a dimension by
  FRESHNESS (did *this* run write it?), never by row count.
- **The script EXITS 0 even when a dimension FAILED.** → grep the log for `FAILED` and for the per-dimension `ok`.
  A run was wrongly marked COMPLETE this way on 2026-08-29.

## RESUMABILITY OF THE CHAIN (know what a restart costs)
| step | resumable? | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 `reclassify_prod.ts` | ✅ FULLY | keyset on PK + `is distinct from` guards + `_reclass_fix` upserted by PK. A re-run skips completed rows. |
| 3 `compute_pitch_log_stuff_plus.ts` | ❌ NO — and it is the costliest to lose | re-scores ALL rows matching the class version instead of filtering `stuff_plus IS NULL`. Every attempt costs the FULL runtime (~36 min staging, longer on prod), and a mid-run failure leaves **v2 labels + STALE scores**. FIX (future): two phases — score only NULLs, then ALWAYS recenter the full population (the recenter must see everything to shift each bucket to mean 100). |
| 4 `aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts` | ⚠ MANUALLY | the 48 dims are independent and `--skip=`/`--only=` exist, but you must pass the completed keys BY HAND. FIX (future): auto-skip dims already written for this run-generation. |

## ⚠ ENVIRONMENTAL FAILURES — do not confuse them with the gateway timeout
Three failures the same night were the LOCAL MACHINE sleeping / dropping its connection, NOT script defects:
staging insert `TypeError: fetch failed` · STEP 3 scoring died at 1,665,000/2,015,321 (~83%) with `read ECONNRESET` ·
STEP 4 first run died at 13/48, second at 39/48.
**Distinguishing symptom:** environmental failures die at DIFFERENT points each run; the `vs_top_hitters` failure died
at the SAME dimension with the SAME duration every time.
✅ **PROVEN PROCESS (Trevor): run long steps DETACHED and let them take however long they need,** with
`caffeinate -dimsu -w <pid>` tied to the process so the machine cannot sleep mid-run. Do not babysit, do not add
aggressive retry loops.

---

## 🏆 PHASE-H CLEANUP — WHAT MUST NEVER BE DROPPED
Phase H lists the Stuff+ `_reclass_*` temp tables as drop candidates. **EXCLUDE these — plus `team_war_snapshots`:**
- **`_reclass_result` (2,000,674 rows)** — the ONLY surviving record of the lost ANCHOR classifier's output. Its source
  code was scratchpad-only and is gone permanently. Now that we standardize on v2, this is the SOLE way to ever measure
  against the old process — the regression baseline for every future classifier change.
- **`_reclass_map` (37,101 rows)** — per-pitcher seed→label resolution; the evidence base for arsenal-conditioning research.
- **`_reclass_pf` (4,804 rows)** — per-pitcher primary-FB velo (the v2 staging run materialized 5,364 rows of it).
- **`team_war_snapshots`** — holds prod's irreplaceable 2025 champions (309 rows). NEVER drop.
Safe to drop: **`_reclass_fix`** (transient writer staging table only).
