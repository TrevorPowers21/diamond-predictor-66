# THE PIPELINE — pitch-log upload → Stuff+ → power ratings → projections → NIL/display (2026-08-17)
> ## ★ CURRENT STATE — READ FIRST (2026-08-30). This supersedes every older statement in this file.
> - **LANE (TOP DOG):** the only correct Stuff+ lane is the **pitch_log lane** —
>   `pitch_log.pitch_type_reclassified` → `compute_pitch_log_stuff_plus.ts` → `pitch_log.stuff_plus` →
>   `aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts` → `pitch_log_pitcher_totals` / `_by_pitch_type` → Season Stats + PitcherProfile.
>   **armHB throughout, self-consistent, CORRECT.**
> - **LEGACY LANE (≤2025 + JUCO ONLY, NEVER 2026):** `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs` → `runStuffPlusPipeline` →
>   `legacy_rollupStuffPlusToMaster` → `"Pitching Master".stuff_plus`. It stores RAW hb, and since commit `e5dec2f` the
>   shared equations expect armHB — so running it scores **LEFT-HANDERS BACKWARDS**. Not live, not on main. Every step in
>   this document has been rewritten onto the pitch_log lane; if you find one that still routes through the legacy lane,
>   it is WRONG. (`legacy_breakingBallReclassification.ts`, renamed from `breakingBallReclassification.ts`, never touched
>   `pitch_log` and is NOT the anchor classifier.)
> - **CLASSIFIER:** `src/savant/lib/stuffPlusClassifierV2.ts` is the SINGLE source (`scripts/reclassify_v2.ts` is only a
>   validation harness; its duplicate copy was deleted). **FINAL ACCURACY = 95.2% per-pitch / 95.3% arsenal-mix /
>   needs_review 8.1%** on the full 2,000,674-pitch population. ⚠ SUPERSEDED — never quote as current: **92.6%, 94.3%,
>   95.1%, "~85%", and any "projected ~95.3-95.4%"**.
> - **DECISION (Trevor, FINAL):** standardize on v2 in **BOTH** environments — **DO overwrite staging's labels.** Any
>   "do NOT overwrite staging's labels" guidance anywhere is REVERSED and obsolete.
> - **STAGING:** the v2 chain is RUN + VERIFIED — backup `_v2_prechain_backup` (2,579,655 rows, DO NOT DROP) ·
>   2,015,321 classified/stamped `v2-ranges-2026-08-28` (needs_review 8.1%) · `_reclass_pf` materialized (5,364
>   pitchers) · baseline armHB SIGN CHECK PASSED 18/18 · 2,015,321 scored + recentered (every type×hand bucket exactly
>   100.0) · step 4 all 48 dimensions + `populate_hitter_run_values`. **Still open on staging:** step 5
>   `derive_masters_from_pitchlog.ts` is DRY-RUN ONLY (0 hitters / 4,675 pitchers would change; never applied on ANY env).
> - **PROD:** still on the OLD per-pitch CASE labels (`"4-Seam Fastball"`, ~2,176,888 labeled of ~2,575,996, no
>   `classification_version`, `needs_review` all null). **v2 has NEVER written to prod.** Prod's DATA is ready (100.00% of
>   `is_data=true` rows are v2-classifiable; venue corrections present and resolving).
> - **⛔ THE ONE REMAINING PROD BLOCKER:** prod's `pitch_log_corrected` VIEW is `select pl.*` **FROZEN at 94 of 99
>   columns** and is MISSING `classification_version`, so the scorer hard-fails there. Fix =
>   `drop view pitch_log_corrected cascade; create view …`. **DDL — requires its own explicit go**, separate from the
>   data-write "prod, now?".
> - **▶ NEXT ACTION:** rebuild that view on prod, then run the prod Stuff+ chain (reclassify → baseline → score →
>   aggregate **with `--direct`** → Masters) in ONE 4-6 h sitting, machine pinned awake.

The "one process." Today it's **scattered manual scripts**; the goal (Track B) is ONE function that fires on ingest and
runs the whole chain, storing everything. This doc is the map: every stage, what it computes, where it STORES (DB), and
where it DISPLAYS. Companion build plan for the Stuff+ leg: `HANDOFF_STUFF_PLUS_2026_08_16.md`.

## ★ KEY CALCULATIONS + PRINCIPLES (Trevor 2026-08-17) — how each aggregate is actually computed
- **The pitch log is the PRIMARY source of truth (highest-frequency), NOT the ONLY source.** The Masters' **power-rating
  INPUTS** — hitter batted-ball + discipline metrics (exit velo, barrel, ev90, pull_air, chase, contact, la, gb, …) AND
  pitcher rate stats — are **pitch-log-derived**, then **married onto the Masters** (they are NOT native Master columns).
  The power ratings (`ba/obp/iso_power_rating`, `pRV+`, `era⁺/fip⁺/whip⁺/…`) and thus `desc_owar/d_war/bsr_war/
  total_desc_war` / `desc_pwar` all flow from pitch-log data. `pull_air / in_zone / spray / zone` = derived-from-pitch-log,
  married on (agreed).
- **★ HITTING/PITCHING MASTER OVERRIDES (Trevor 2026-08-17).** In SOME scenarios a Master-level override supplies values
  the pitch log can't — **baserunning above all, plus some other fields** — uploaded **less frequently than the pitch
  log**. So the re-derive pass is **pitch-log-primary + Master-override-aware**: where an override exists it WINS and the
  pitch-log re-derivation must **NOT clobber it** (same discipline as preserving coach toggles — the "one function" merges,
  never blindly overwrites). Overrides are the exception, not the norm; the pitch log still drives the vast majority.
- **Conference Stuff+ (V2, canonical) =** the **pitch-weighted mean of EVERY pitcher in the conference across the FULL
  season**: `Σ(pitcher Stuff+ × his pitch count) / Σ(pitch count)`. It is the conference's **pitching depth/quality**.
- **Conference HTP =** the same idea for **hitters** — the conference's aggregate hitter talent across ALL its teams,
  full season. `HTP = OPR + 1.25·(Stuff+−100) + 0.75·park` (post wRC+→park swap).
- **Conference stats are CONFERENCE-vs-CONFERENCE only.** The conference is the unit of comparison — the aggregates rank
  conferences against each other (how tough is conf X vs Y). That comparison is exactly what the projection
  competition-translation lever consumes (a player projected INTO conf X faces conf X's Stuff+ / HTP).
- **Projections must FILL the snapshots WITHOUT touching toggles.** The returner/transfer recompute writes
  `player_snapshot` / `transfer_snapshot` **preserving any coach-set toggles** (dev aggressiveness, roster status, class
  transition, cornerstone) — never resets them — and **refreshes ALL displayed metrics to the most current values** (this
  is Step 7c).
- **Savant is DEAD/unused** — clear it after this work (logged to memory). The live surface for pitch-log stats is the
  **Season Stats display**; every stat, filter, and visual there must be pitch-log-derived + stored up-to-date.
- **Park factors = re-evaluate AFTER Stuff+ (quick).** [[project_park_factor_rework]] — next-after-Stuff+, small pass.

## Stage table (compute → store → display)

| # | Stage | Computes | Stores (DB) | Displays |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ingest | — | `pitch_log` (per-pitch); `Hitter Master`/`Pitching Master` (season stats) | — |
| 2 | Derive from pitch_log | dRS defense, wSB baserunning, pull_air/in_zone/spray/zone (+ all power-rating inputs) | `player_season_defense`, `player_season_baserunning`, **married onto the Masters**. ⛔ NOT `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs` — that is the LEGACY lane (≤2025 + JUCO only) | Season Stats display |
| 3 | **Stuff+** (the build, pitch_log lane) | reclassify (v2) → re-derive baseline → 9-eq score → recenter → aggregate → marry onto Masters | `pitch_log.pitch_type_reclassified` + `.classification_version` + `.needs_review`, `pitch_log.stuff_plus`, `pitcher_stuff_plus_ncaa`, `pitch_log_pitcher_totals`/`_by_pitch_type`, `Conference Stuff+ (V2)`, `Pitching Master.stuff_plus`. ⛔ never `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs.stuff_plus` for 2026 | Season Stats display (Stuff+, pitch mix) |
| 3b | **Season-stats dimension aggregation** (needs 3 done + Hitter Master top-quartile for `vs_top_hitters`) | per-dimension slash line + rates + by-pitch-type across splits: `all, vs_lhp/rhp, vs_92plus, vs_stuff_100/105plus, vs_fastball/breaking/offspeed, vs_top_hitters` (48 aggs / 10 dims) | `pitch_log_hitter_totals`, `pitch_log_pitcher_totals`, `*_by_pitch_type` (keyed `dimension_key`) | **Season Stats display** (`/stats` → `PitchLogSection`). ⚠ still an OFFLINE hand-run script (`scripts/aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts`, now with `--prod`/`--direct`/`--only=`) → Track B must absorb it; `conf_only`/intra-conf split not built. 🛑 on PROD run it with `--direct`. |
| 4 | Power ratings (Masters) | hitter ba/obp/iso ratings (+pull_air) → desc WAR; pitcher pRV+/era⁺/… → desc pWAR | `Hitter Master` + `Pitching Master` (ratings + `desc_*` / `total_desc_war` cols) | Player/Pitcher Profile, Rankings |
| 5 | Conference baselines | Conf Stuff+ (depth), wRC+, park factors, HTP | `Conference Stats` | Team Builder context |
| 5.5 | **Projection calibration (NEW, 2026-08-24)** | per-stat mean + TWO-SIDED SD (`sd_good`/`sd_bad`) on the qualified pop (min IP/AB) + `pr_sd` from stage-4 ratings — fixes the z-shift over-projecting elite (impossible HR9/ERA) | `model_config` (per-stat `*_sd_good`/`*_sd_bad`/`*_ncaa_avg`/`*_qual_min`) | (feeds stage 6) — see `AGENT_LEARNINGS_projection_calibration_two_sided_sd_2026_08_24.md`. NOT built yet. |
| 6 | Projections | returner + transfer engine (blend → competition translation via Stuff+/HTP/park → class/dev → depth-role → WAR → market); **reads stage-5.5 two-sided SDs, directional (sd_good toward elite, sd_bad toward poor)** | `player_predictions` (o_war, p_war, total_hitter_war, market_value, rates) | Rankings, Profiles, Team Builder, Transfer Portal |
| 7 | NIL + need | score = total_WAR × PTM → allocateNil curve + need premium | (computed live; GM `gm_budget.nil_allocation_mode`) | Team Builder, GM, Target Board |

## Current vs target
- **Current:** stages 2–5 (+ **3b**) are **scattered one-off scripts run by hand** (`reclassify_prod`, `compute_pitch_log_stuff_plus`, `derive_masters_from_pitchlog`, `conferenceStuffPlusV2`, `populate-conference-stats-env-plus`, `aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions` (3b, season-stats splits), the Master rating stores, the conf-stats Bucket-A/OPR/HTP producers, …) — easy to forget → stale baselines/conference/season-stats values.
- **Target (Track B):** ONE function fires on pitch-log ingest and runs stages 2→3→**3b**→4→5→6 in order, stamped `classification_version` + `constants_version`, re-deriving every downstream aggregate in the same pass (no old-taxonomy means survive). 3b (season-stats splits) runs after Stuff+ (3), independent of projections (6). Stage 1 Master-CSV ingest stays a separate upload; the pipeline marries its pitch-log derivations onto the Masters.
- **Sequencing rule:** Stuff+ (stage 3) must be FINAL before the transfer recompute (stage 6, Step 6b) so projections land once. NIL's `total_hitter_war` + need-premium wiring rides the 6b/7c recompute.

---
## ★ ADD: Season-stats dimension aggregation — a MISSING edge-fn stage (2026-08-21 audit)
The player-facing **Season Stats** display (`/dashboard/player/:id/stats` → `PlayerStatsPage` → savant COMPONENT `PitchLogSection`; pitcher `/dashboard/pitcher/:id/stats`) shows a filtered slash line + rate tables across **dimension splits**: hitter `all, vs_lhp, vs_rhp, vs_92plus, vs_stuff_100plus, vs_stuff_105plus, vs_fastball, vs_breaking_ball, vs_offspeed`; pitcher `all, vs_lhp, vs_rhp, vs_fastball, vs_breaking_ball, vs_offspeed, vs_top_hitters`.
- **These are STORED + read** from `pitch_log_hitter_totals` / `pitch_log_pitcher_totals` (+ `*_by_pitch_type`), keyed by `dimension_key`. Staging: 50,418 / 37,306 rows (2026). No browser aggregation on the Stats tab. ✅
- **BUT the producer is an OFFLINE hand-run script**: `scripts/aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts` (`npm run aggregate-pitch-log-dimensions -- --apply`) — NOT in the edge fn. Dry-run VERIFIED working 2026-08-21 (48 aggregations across 10 dimensions, 967 top-quartile hitter IDs resolved, exit 0). **→ Track B must ABSORB this per-dimension aggregation into the on-upload path** (same "retire the scattered scripts" goal as stages 2–5). Prod: this script must run to fill the totals tables (add to runbook if not already an explicit ordered step — currently only the `.ip` column patch F1 + team_season_stats re-source reference these tables).
- **Hitter descriptive run values (added 2026-08-26):** `scripts/aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts` now calls `select populate_hitter_run_values(2026);` at the END of its run, filling `batting_rv/defensive_rv/baserunning_rv` (+ national `*_z`) on the `dimension_key='all'` rows of `pitch_log_hitter_totals` (batting from the fresh counts, defensive=drs_floor, baserunning=wsb_runs). Displayed as the "VALUE" cluster on the hitter Season Stats banner (pure-read). **→ When Track B absorbs stage 3b, it MUST also call `populate_hitter_run_values(season)` after the hitter aggregation** (needs the fresh `all`-row counts + reads `player_season_defense`/`player_season_baserunning`). `docs/AGENT_LEARNINGS_hitter_run_values_2026_08_26.md`.
- **Live-compute that remains (acceptable):** the **Visuals tab** fine filters (pitch type × zone location × batted-ball) aggregate raw `pitch_log` client-side (`PitchLogSection` `filteredPitches` useMemo). Combinatorial → arguably fine to leave live; NOT a stored-first violation worth precomputing.
- **UNBUILT (planned):** no `conf_only` (`is_conference_game`) dimension, no home/away, no date-range, no per-player intra-conf split storage (`season_stats` is a single slash line, no `*_reg`). If a conference-only toggle is wanted on the season-stats page, the edge fn needs a new `conf_only` `dimension_key` in this aggregation. [[project_conference_stats_scope_rule]]

## ★ SAVANT deletion guardrail (2026-08-21) — pages vs components
Splitting `src/savant/` for the "clear stale savant" cleanup:
- **`src/savant/pages/*`** (SavantHitterPage, SavantPitcherPage, SavantTeamProfile, SavantConferenceStats) = OLD internal pages, reachable ONLY via `/savant/*` (email-allowlist `SavantRoute`, App.tsx:150-167). NOT the coach player-eval workflow. These hold the out-of-date LIVE oWAR/pWAR (TeamProfilePage) + z×20 env+ (ConferenceStatsPage) compute. **SAFE to delete.**
- **`src/savant/components/*` + `hooks/*` + `lib/*`** (esp. `PitchLogSection`) = LOAD-BEARING for the live coach routes (`PlayerStatsPage`/`PitcherStatsPage` `/stats`, plus PlayerProfile/PitcherProfile/ReturningPlayers/GM import savant hooks+lib). **DO NOT delete** — a blanket `rm -rf src/savant` breaks the real season-stats display.
- The active coach player-eval pages are the NON-savant `PlayerProfile` / `PitcherProfile` / `PlayerHub` (App.tsx:119-123). So the "savant is not used" statement is true for savant **pages**, not savant **components**.

## ★★★ THE FORWARD RECLASSIFICATION → STUFF+ PROCESS (FINAL). LINEAR + per-pitcher usage-weighted.
This is the committed go-forward for BOTH the prod regen AND Track B on-ingest. NO feedback loop, NO `gyro_stuff_plus`,
NO score-flip (all dropped). The classifier is `src/savant/lib/stuffPlusClassifierV2.ts` — the SINGLE source, driven by
`scripts/reclassify_prod.ts`; `scripts/reclassify_v2.ts` is a VALIDATION HARNESS only (its duplicate copy was deleted).
1. **CLASSIFY by the derived RANGES.** Per-pitch 10-bucket SEED (incl. `FBSTRIP` = FA/SI rr∈[−4,4] strip) → per-pitcher
   cluster (merge Δarmhb<4 & Δivb<3.5 & Δvelo<2.5, **with the fastball-family MERGE GUARD**) → label-by-MEAN vs the CORE
   ranges (per pitch × hand, handedness-normalized armHB) → §4.5 gyro cluster-centroid floor (`GYRO_ARMHB_FLOOR = -3`)
   → seam-local usage backfill → tiebreakers (CT/SL ride-floor, gyro/curve blend). ⚠ **ORDERING IS LOAD-BEARING:** §4.5
   runs BEFORE the step-4 backfill (and therefore before `tiebreak()`).
2. **TRACK USAGE %.** Per pitcher, from the CLEAR pitches, compute the % of each pitch type he throws → his true arsenal.
3. **BACKFILL the seam-unclear.** Fold each seam-unclear cluster into the pitcher's DOMINANT CLOSE-PROXIMITY pitch —
   USAGE-WEIGHTED, not just nearest. Reserve `needs_review` ONLY for genuinely distinct RARE pitches, NOT seam bleed.
4. **RUN THE FULL STUFF+ ONCE.** `src/savant/lib/stuffPlusEngine.ts` scores each pitch by its FINAL label via the
   pitch-type switch (`calcGyroSlider` = the SINGLE gyro eq) → recenter per (pitch_type × hand) to mean 100.
5. **AGGREGATE over the full season** → per-pitcher TRUE overall Stuff+ + usage %.
**FINAL MEASURED ACCURACY: 95.2% per-pitch / 95.3% arsenal-mix / needs_review 8.1%** on the full 2,000,674-pitch
population. (The stage-by-stage session numbers — 85.2% → 91.5% → 92.6% → 94.3% → 95.1% — are HISTORICAL only.)
Prod = REGENERATE end-to-end (never copy). Full numbers: `docs/STUFF_PLUS_EXACT_VALUES.md` §11.

### ★ STEP 3 REFINEMENT (Trevor) — the proximity gate is the whole game; fold is SEAM-LOCAL + TIGHT, never "nearest anchor"
The usage-weighted backfill applies ONLY to genuinely-borderline pitches. Three cases:
1. **Core pitch** (cluster centroid clearly inside one type's range, FAR from any seam) → KEEP its label; usage is
   IRRELEVANT. (e.g. a −15 IVB cluster is nowhere near the gyro band → it stays Curve/Sweeper no matter the arsenal.)
2. **Borderline** (centroid near a SEAM between two adjacent types AND within a TIGHT movement distance of one of those
   two seam-adjacent pitches the pitcher actually throws) → fold to the HIGHER-USAGE of those two. Usage only breaks the
   tie WHEN MOVEMENT CANNOT. Gate: `moveDist < 5 AND |Δvelo| < 3`, folding only into a strictly-larger anchor.
3. **Distinct but far from all his pitches** → KEEP its own label + `needs_review`. A pitcher can throw 1 of any pitch
   in the sport; never erase it.
GATE = tight movement distance to a SEAM-ADJACENT dominant pitch — NOT "nearest anchor" (that sloppy version would
swallow legit distinct pitches).

## ★★★★ THE CHAIN AS SHIPPED — what is BUILT, and the one thing that is not
- ✅ **v2 classifier BUILT + validated + committed** — `src/savant/lib/stuffPlusClassifierV2.ts`, **95.2% / 95.3%**.
  Stuff+ cross-check PASSED: per-pitcher overall Stuff+ |Δ| mean 0.85, 91% within ±2 → the classification difference is
  product-invisible.
- ✅ **Prod/staging WRITER BUILT + prod DRY-RUN PASSED** — `scripts/reclassify_prod.ts` (`--dry-run` on prod =
  2,013,005 labels; distribution matches staging). `--go` (needs PGURI + "prod, now?") writes via keyset/direct session.
  It also materializes `_reclass_pf`.
- ✅ **v2 REPLACES v1 in the pipeline.** `scripts/recompute-stuff-plus.ts` ran `runBreakingBallReclassification` (the OLD
  v1: gyroCap 6/3, no FBSTRIP, no seam-local backfill) and would CLOBBER v2 — **so the whole legacy orchestrator is out
  of the 2026 path**, and the legacy lane is gated out of `npm run import:prod` (the npm `recompute-stuff*:prod`
  scripts were DELETED). v2 labels live in `pitch_log.pitch_type_reclassified`.
- ⛔ **There is NO "A5 aggregate into `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs`" step.** That was a FALSE requirement: PSP-I is the
  LEGACY lane and the live chain never goes through it. Scoring happens **per pitch** in
  `compute_pitch_log_stuff_plus.ts`, and the rollup to `Pitching Master.stuff_plus` happens via
  `derive_masters_from_pitchlog.ts` — **never `legacy_rollupStuffPlusToMaster`**.
- ⛔ **NOT DONE:** the prod run itself. It is gated on rebuilding prod's stale `pitch_log_corrected` VIEW (DDL, own go),
  then the full chain in one sitting.
### TRACK B: this exact linear chain is the on-ingest edge fn (`project_unified_projection_edge_function`); the classifier + scoring are the committed forward process.

---

## ★★★ THE STUFF+ CHAIN — pitch_log lane (the ONLY correct order)
Any Stuff+ step that routes through `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs` → `runStuffPlusPipeline` →
`legacy_rollupStuffPlusToMaster` → `"Pitching Master".stuff_plus` is the **LEGACY lane** and is WRONG for 2026. It
revives the latent raw-HB bug (`e5dec2f` removed `hbSign`; PSP-I still stores RAW hb ⇒ left-handers scored backwards)
and writes numbers nothing displays. **Never run it for 2026.**

1. **Reclassify** → `pitch_log.pitch_type_reclassified` + `classification_version` + `needs_review`
   `scripts/reclassify_prod.ts` (v2 classifier; `--dry-run` first, then `--go` with PGURI + explicit "prod, now?";
   `--target=staging` for staging). Also MATERIALIZES `_reclass_pf` as a by-product — the scorer hard-depends on it.
2. **Re-derive the pop baseline** → `pitcher_stuff_plus_ncaa` (per pitch_type × hand, **armHB**, D1-only).
   ⚠ MANDATORY, not optional: the §4.5 gyro fix moves 6-8% of ALL breaking-ball volume Slider→Gyro Slider, so every
   mix-dependent artifact is invalid until regenerated. The deriver ABORTS before writing if the armHB sign check fails.
3. **Score per pitch** → `pitch_log.stuff_plus` — `scripts/compute_pitch_log_stuff_plus.ts`
   🛑 **MUST READ BEFORE RUNNING THIS STEP:** the version filter is now parameterized (`--class-version=`, defaulting to
   the v2 stamp) — it used to be hard-coded to `v1-anchor-2026-08-17`, which silently matched 0 rows and left NEW LABELS
   + OLD SCORES. This step is idempotent but does **NOT** resume: every attempt costs the FULL runtime (~36 min on
   staging, longer on prod) and a mid-run failure leaves v2 labels + STALE scores. Run it DETACHED with
   `caffeinate -dimsu -w <pid>`. Requires `_reclass_pf` (materialized by step 1).
   (normalizes hb→armHB itself; recenters each (pitch_type × hand) bucket to mean 100)
4. **Aggregate** → `pitch_log_pitcher_totals` / `pitch_log_hitter_totals` / `*_by_pitch_type`
   `scripts/aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts --apply` (also calls `populate_hitter_run_values(season)`)
   🛑 **MUST READ BEFORE RUNNING THIS STEP → see "STEP 4 — SOLVED: USE `--direct`" below.** On PROD you MUST run ALL of
   step 4 with `--direct` (the HTTP gateway cuts at ~125s; `vs_top_hitters` needs 253s on staging, longer on prod, and a
   failure HALTS the dimensions after it). Validate by CONTENT + FRESHNESS — never by exit code or row count.
5. **Marry onto the Masters** → `scripts/derive_masters_from_pitchlog.ts --apply`
   (its `readAll` pagination is now `.order(PK)`-ed — unordered `.range()` over ~2.5M rows silently dropped/duped).
6. Then continue the runbook: C23–C29 → Phase D (dWAR) → E (precomputes) → F (re-bakes) → G (edge fn) → H (drops).

**INVARIANTS**
- ⚠ A label change invalidates every downstream number. Steps 1→5 must complete in the SAME working session;
  never leave an environment with new labels and old `stuff_plus`.
- `hb` is stored RAW everywhere and displayed raw. armHB is a COMPUTE convention only — normalize in memory.
  NEVER rewrite the stored `hb` column.
- One consistent label vocabulary: `4S FB` (not `4-Seam Fastball`) + a `classification_version` stamp on every row.
- Full detail + evidence: `docs/STUFF_PLUS_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`; exact numbers: `docs/STUFF_PLUS_EXACT_VALUES.md` §11.

## ★★★ TRACK B — STUFF+ STAGE, LOCKED SPEC. Supersedes any earlier Stuff+ description in this file.
Track B = ONE function on pitch-log ingest (weekly/biweekly, local folder watch). Master-sheet uploads come LATER as a
CHECK + to override only what pitch_log cannot produce (e.g. AVG/SB). **pitch_log is the SOURCE OF TRUTH.**
The Stuff+ stage is exactly steps 1→5 of "THE STUFF+ CHAIN" above, in one run — a label change invalidates every number
below it. Then: power ratings → conference baselines → projections → market/NIL.

**⛔ WHAT TRACK B MUST NEVER DO**
- NEVER route Stuff+ through the LEGACY lane: `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs` → `runStuffPlusPipeline` →
  `legacy_rollupStuffPlusToMaster` → `"Pitching Master".stuff_plus`. Nothing reads it for 2026 and it carries the latent
  raw-HB bug (`e5dec2f` removed `hbSign`; PSP-I stores RAW hb ⇒ left-handers scored BACKWARDS).
- NEVER call `legacy_breakingBallReclassification` (v1, renamed from `breakingBallReclassification.ts`). It writes
  `rstr_pitch_class` on PSP-I, has never touched `pitch_log`, and is NOT the anchor classifier. Conflating the two cost a
  full day (2026-08-28/29).
- NEVER rewrite the stored `hb` column to armHB. `hb` is RAW by design (the UI displays it; the CSV importer writes it
  raw). armHB is a COMPUTE convention — normalize in memory only.
- NEVER leave new labels with stale scores. Steps 1→5 are one transaction-of-work.

**LANE COVERAGE (measured):** `pitch_log` is **D1-only** — 5,303 pitchers. PSP-I covers 7,012; the 1,709 difference is
**1,627 NJCAA_D1 + 81 D1 + 1 D2**. → **JUCO has no pitch logs and stays CSV-derived** (scored vs D1 baselines). Track B's
pitch_log chain covers D1 only; do not let it silently drop JUCO. JUCO process is being restarted separately.

## ★★★ STUFF+ v2 CLASSIFIER — FINAL STATE + CONCLUSIONS (2026-08-30). Numbers: `docs/STUFF_PLUS_EXACT_VALUES.md` §11.
**SINGLE SOURCE:** `src/savant/lib/stuffPlusClassifierV2.ts`. `scripts/reclassify_v2.ts` is a VALIDATION HARNESS only —
its duplicate copy of the classifier was DELETED (that duplication is exactly why earlier numbers drifted).

**FINAL ACCURACY — full population, all 4,804 pitchers / 2,000,674 pitches of `_reclass_result`:**
**1,904,808 / 2,000,674 = 95.2% per-pitch · arsenal-mix 95.3% · needs_review 8.1%** (§11.13 — with §4.5 running BEFORE
the step-4 backfill). ⚠ **SUPERSEDED, never quote as current:** 92.6% (measured on the deleted duplicate copy),
94.3% (pre-gyro-fix), 95.1% (§4.5 running after the fold), "~85%" (the abandoned Tier-2 reconstruction), and any
"projected ~95.3-95.4%".

**THREE FIXES SHIPPED (all measured, none guessed):**
1. **Offspeed armHB floor** `armhb > 0` → **`armhb >= 5`**. Gyro armHB p99=4.7 vs offspeed p1=5.3 — a clean empty gap.
   Killed `Gyro→Change-up` (338 losses) and `Cutter→Change-up` (29) outright.
2. **Fastball-family MERGE GUARD** — never merge clusters whose fastball-family seeds (`4S FB`/`Sinker`/`FBSTRIP`)
   differ. Merge was swallowing the FBSTRIP cluster before it could be resolved; **>60% of all 4S↔Sinker errors** were
   merged FBSTRIP clusters. 91.69% → 93.01%; 4S↔Sinker errors 2,830 → 1,676 (−41%). Also preserves genuine
   two-fastball arms (14ivb/8hb vs 8ivb/14hb at equal velo stay SEPARATE; 14/8 vs 13/9 correctly merge).
3. **§4.5 gyro/slider cluster-centroid floor** `GYRO_ARMHB_FLOOR = -3`, applied **BEFORE the step-4 backfill** (and
   therefore before `tiebreak()`). `Gyro→Slider` 1,675→471 / 1,788→508; `Gyro→Cutter` 415→131 / 437→56; zero
   fastball/offspeed regression. Ordering is load-bearing and is worth the final +0.1pp over the "after the fold" build.

**TWO NEGATIVE RESULTS — do NOT rebuild these:**
- `rr > -1.7` FBSTRIP cut (made agreement WORSE: disputes 1,443 → 2,503; it was fit on a merge-corrupted population).
  `rr >= 0` stays — within noise of the 91.9% @ rr=-0.13 optimum.
- The **"arsenal rule"** (flip Slider→Gyro when the pitcher has a GY seed and no SW seed) is a **CONFOUND**, not a rule:
  sweeper-presence predicts the anchor 71.5% vs 89.1% for the cluster's own mean armHB. Implemented literally it
  **LOSES 0.97/1.26pp**. Do not rebuild it from the `_reclass_map` contingency table.
**VERIFIED ALREADY-OPTIMAL (do not touch):** Sweeper/Slider armHB −12 (1.0% error) · Gyro/Slider armHB −5.

**★ DECISION — STANDARDIZE ON v2 IN BOTH ENVIRONMENTS (Trevor, FINAL; EXACT_VALUES §11.12).**
The coherence partition (234 pitchers, 1,188 decidable disputes, run after all three fixes) measured that the ANCHOR
wins the disputed residual **55.9 / 44.1**. That measurement STANDS, and its cost is quantified: ≈11,700 pitches ≈
**0.6% of the population**. We pay it, because the anchor has **NO SOURCE CODE** (lost scratchpad) — it can never be
re-run, on new data or on prod — while v2 is committed, versioned, re-runnable, and is what Track B needs on every
ingest, with ONE vocabulary + a `classification_version` stamp in both environments.
→ **DO overwrite staging's `pitch_type_reclassified` with v2.** Any "do NOT overwrite staging's labels" guidance
(including the earlier framing in SOURCE_OF_TRUTH §4 and EXACT_VALUES §11.11) is **REVERSED and obsolete**.
→ **PRESERVE `_reclass_result`** — the sole surviving record of the anchor, and the regression baseline for every
future classifier change.
⚠ Limitation kept on the record: the coherence partition does NOT cover the Gyro↔Slider pair (23,048 pitches, the
largest residual) — centroids were unavailable after the §4.5 fix. Whether the −3 floor over-calls gyro relative to
physical truth is STILL UNMEASURED; do not claim it either way.

**⚠ DOWNSTREAM — NOT display-only.** The gyro fix moves **6-8% of ALL breaking-ball volume** Slider→Gyro Slider. Every
mix-dependent artifact MUST be regenerated after a reclass run: `pitcher_stuff_plus_ncaa` baselines, D1/regional means
+ SDs, pitch-shape percentiles. Reclassify → baseline → score → aggregate MUST complete in ONE session.

**PROD STATUS:** prod pitch_log is on the OLD per-pitch CASE labels (`"4-Seam Fastball"` naming, ~2,176,888 labeled of
~2,575,996, NO `classification_version` stamp, `needs_review` all null) — **v2 has NEVER written to prod**; the prior
prod work was a read-only dry run. v2 vs prod's existing labels = **70.9% agreement (v2 would change 584,130 pitches =
29.1%)**, and v2 is far closer to the validated set (distribution deviation from anchor **38.7 → 21.6**), correcting
prod's Cutter 10.3%→3.7% (anchor 2.4%) and Splitter 0.7%→2.1% (anchor 2.2%). Prod run is GATED on PGURI + an explicit
"prod, now?" and MUST be followed immediately by the rest of the Stuff+ chain.

---

# STAGE 0 — PRE-PROD BLOCKER STATUS (updated 2026-08-30): **1 OPEN, THE REST RESOLVED**
Prod's **DATA is ready** — 100.00% of prod's `is_data=true` rows (~1,906,398) are v2-classifiable, venue corrections
resolve, same games/window as staging. Every blocker was CODE or SCHEMA, and all but one have shipped.

## ⛔ STILL OPEN — the only thing blocking the prod chain
1. **PROD `pitch_log_corrected` VIEW IS STALE — missing `classification_version`.** The view is `select pl.*, …` and
   Postgres FREEZES `*` at creation time, so prod's view is stuck at **94 columns** vs the base table's 99. Missing:
   `classification_version, needs_review, ab_num_in_game, pitch_num_in_game, pitch_num_in_ab, park_code,
   is_conference_game, game_string`. Running the scorer's query against prod returns
   `column pitch_log_corrected.classification_version does not exist`. Same query on staging = OK.
   ⚠ `create or replace view` will NOT fix it (new columns land mid-list) → needs **`drop view pitch_log_corrected
   cascade; create view …`** rebuilt against the current column list. **DDL — requires an explicit go, separate from the
   data-write "prod, now?".** (Reclassification itself is unaffected — `reclassify_prod.ts` doesn't read those columns.)

## ✅ RESOLVED — shipped; do NOT re-raise these as blockers
2. **Scorer version filter — RESOLVED.** It was hard-coded `.eq("classification_version","v1-anchor-2026-08-17")` while
   `reclassify_prod.ts` stamps `v2-ranges-2026-08-28`, so it silently matched 0 rows (new labels + old scores). It is now
   **parameterized (`--class-version=`, defaulting to the v2 stamp)**. *Evidence:* on staging steps 1→3 connected
   end-to-end and scored 2,015,321 rows. (This also supersedes the old checklist item "do NOT loosen the filter".)
3. **`_reclass_pf` producer — RESOLVED.** `reclassify_prod.ts` now materializes it as a by-product of `pfbVelo()`.
   *Evidence:* the staging run materialized **5,364 pitchers**, and step 2 read it back.
4. **`aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts` prod path — RESOLVED.** It now has a prod path + a `--prod` guard, plus the NEW
   `--direct` and `--only=` flags. *Evidence:* `--direct` cleared `vs_top_hitters` on staging in 253.2s.
5. **§4.5 ordering — RESOLVED.** §4.5 runs BEFORE the step-4 backfill; measured **95.2% / 95.3%** (§11.13) — strictly
   better on both metrics than the 95.1% "after the fold" ordering, so there is nothing left to measure or revert.
6. **Ordered pagination — RESOLVED.** `derive_masters_from_pitchlog.ts` `readAll` is ordered, plus two further
   ordered-pagination fixes (`backfill_trackman_pitches_pitching_master.ts`, `compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus.ts`).
7. **Legacy lane gated out of the live prod CSV path — RESOLVED.** `scripts/import-csvs/runner.ts` (= `npm run
   import:prod`, which goes DIRECT to prod) no longer runs the legacy raw-HB lane, and npm `recompute-stuff:prod` /
   `recompute-stuff-scoped:prod` were **DELETED**. A routine TruMedia import can no longer score left-handers backwards.
8. **Ledger entries — RESOLVED.** C20 park_code (2,576,146 = 100%), C21 `is_conference_game` + C22 sequence
   (2,576,146), and migration `20260828000000_pitch_log_classification_version_needs_review.sql` are all logged in
   `PROD_MIGRATIONS_TODO.md`.
9. **Staging reclassification writer — RESOLVED.** `reclassify_prod.ts --target=staging`, with a double-keyed guard
   (it refuses unless PGURI's project ref matches the named target).

## ⚠ CLAIMS THAT ARE FALSE — audits disproved them; do not treat any of these as live blockers
"A5 aggregator (pitch_log → `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs`) is missing" · "the baseline deriver is missing" ·
"the live path has a pop/row convention mismatch" · "the v2 reclassification WRITER does not exist" ·
"the classifier is only ~85% and cannot reach its gate". All verified present / correct / superseded.

## OPEN BUT NOT BLOCKING
- **C21/C22 derive-over-copy follow-up.** They were COPIED from staging (`_next_derived.ts`), not derived. Prod must be
  able to DERIVE `park_code` / `is_conference_game` / sequence going forward or **Track B breaks on the next ingest.**
- **Migration `20260829120000_gm_budget_nil_allocation_mode.sql`** — committed, **NOT yet applied to either env.**
- **Row-count populations, pinned so gates are falsifiable** (these are DIFFERENT populations, not a contradiction):
  2,576,230 = prod pitch_log total pre-dedup · 2,576,146 = park_code/is_conf/sequence filled · ~2,176,888 = prod rows
  carrying an OLD CASE label · 2,013,005 = the v2 prod DRY-RUN label count · **prod `is_data=true` ≈ 1,906,398**
  (74.01% of 2,575,996) · staging v2 classified/stamped = 2,015,321.

## GREEN — verified ready on prod (audit 2026-08-29, read-only)

⚠ `vaa` column absent on prod — NOT a blocker (100% NULL on staging; neither classifier nor scorer reads it).

# ▶️ STAGING + PROD STATE, AND THE NEXT ACTIONS (2026-08-30)

## ✅ DONE + VERIFIED ON STAGING (do NOT redo)
| step | result |
|---|---|
| 0 backup | `_v2_prechain_backup` = **2,579,655 rows** / 2,191,583 labeled / 2,014,152 scored. **DO NOT DROP until the chain is signed off.** Reverses everything via one UPDATE…FROM join on `uniq_pitch_id`. |
| 1 classify | **2,015,321** stamped `v2-ranges-2026-08-28`, needs_review **8.1%**, 101 batches, updated 1,995,321. `_reclass_pf` materialized (**5,364** pitchers) — NEW producer, first ever run, works. |
| 2 baseline | **✓ armHB SIGN CHECK PASSED ON ALL 18 BUCKETS** → upserted 18/18. The armHB convention is now PROVEN, not assumed (the deriver aborts before writing if it fails). |
| 3 score | **2,015,321 scored + recentered** (35.7 min). unscored = 0. Every (type×hand) bucket recenters to **exactly 100.0**. |
| 4 aggregate | **ALL 48 dimensions refreshed** + `populate_hitter_run_values(2026)` ✓. The 3 `vs_top_hitters` aggregations that had failed on the gateway were completed over the DIRECT pg session (`--direct`). Tables: pitcher_totals 37,575 · hitter_totals 50,633 · pitcher_by_pitch_type 186,622 · hitter_by_pitch_type 301,957 · hitter run values 6,053. |

**★ PROD-GATE TOLERANCE (pre-registered): per-pitcher Stuff+ mean 99.3 · p50 99.3 · p10 93.1 · p90 105.7 ·
4,234 pitchers.** Prod must land within tolerance of this or **ABORT**.

## ⚠ STILL OPEN ON STAGING
- **Step 5 `derive_masters_from_pitchlog.ts` — DRY RUN ONLY.** Dry run: **0 hitters / 4,675 pitchers** would change
  (of 4,772 above-gate). It has NEVER been applied on ANY environment. Review the diff before `--apply`.

## ▶️ NEXT ACTIONS, IN ORDER
1. Review + apply step 5 (Masters) on staging.
2. **PROD BLOCKER FIRST — rebuild the stale view:** prod `pitch_log_corrected` is `select pl.*` frozen at **94 of 99
   columns** and MISSING `classification_version`, so the scorer hard-fails there. Needs
   `drop view pitch_log_corrected cascade; create view …`. **DDL — needs its own explicit go, separate from "prod, now?".**
3. Apply migration `20260829120000_gm_budget_nil_allocation_mode.sql` to BOTH envs (committed, never run).
4. Prod chain: reclassify → baseline → score → aggregate (**`--direct` from the start**) → Masters. Then C23→C29,
   Phase D→H per the runbook, on the pitch_log lane.

## ⏱ PROD TIME BUDGET
Staging actuals: step 1 ≈ **75 min** (load + classify + 2M keyset UPDATE) · step 3 ≈ **36 min** · step 4 ≈ **50 min**
→ **staging total ≈ 2.5-3 h.** Prod is a SMALLER compute tier with a MORE throttled disk and its `exec_sql` already
times out on lighter queries → **budget 4-6 h for the prod Stuff+ block alone**, plus C23-C29 and Phases D-H after it.
Do it in **ONE sitting** with the machine pinned awake (`caffeinate -dimsu -w <pid>`) — steps 1→5 must not be split,
because a gap leaves prod with **v2 labels + STALE scores**.
⚠ **Step 3 does NOT resume** (it re-scores everything matching the class version), so any interruption costs the FULL
runtime again. The two-phase fix (score only `stuff_plus IS NULL`, then ALWAYS recenter across the full population) is
worth building BEFORE the prod run — the recenter must see the whole population, which is why a naive resume is wrong.

---

# ✅ STEP 4 (`aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions`) — SOLVED: USE `--direct`. (staging-proven 2026-08-30)
**ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED, not theorised.** Every aggregation in this script ran through `exec_sql` over the HTTP gateway
(`aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts:1035`), and the gateway cuts the client at ~125s — the work is LOST.
`[40/48] vs_top_hitters → pitcher_totals — FAILED after 125.3s: upstream request timeout`, **reproduced EXACTLY twice**
(same dimension, same error, same duration). That query must resolve the top-quartile hitter set (~967 IDs) and filter
~2M pitches against it. Over the **DIRECT pg session the SAME query succeeded in 253.2s** — it simply needs ~2× the
gateway's ceiling; nothing else changed. 47 of 48 dimensions run fine (~60-72s each). ⚠ The script **HALTS** on a
failure, so dimensions 41-48 never ran either — one bad dimension blocked 9.

## THE COMMANDS
Staging (single dimension):
```
npx tsx --env-file .env.local scripts/aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts --apply --direct --only=vs_top_hitters
```
**PROD — run the WHOLE of step 4 with `--direct`, not just this dimension:**
```
npx tsx --env-file .env.production.local scripts/aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts --apply --prod --direct
```
`vs_top_hitters` already needs 253s on STAGING. Prod is a smaller compute tier with a more throttled disk (expect
~8-10 min for that one dimension) and prod's `exec_sql` has ALREADY been observed timing out on lighter queries →
through the gateway it would fail on prod **100% of the time**, and the halt would block the 8 dimensions after it.
**`--direct` is NOT a staging workaround — it is the REQUIRED path on prod.**

## FLAGS ON `aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts`
- **`--direct`** (new 2026-08-30) — executes over the `PGURI` session (`statement_timeout=0`, no gateway ceiling)
  instead of `exec_sql`. Guarded: the PGURI project ref MUST match the target env or it refuses to run. Logs the path used.
- **`--only=<keys>`** (new 2026-08-30) — mirrors `--skip=`; runs ONLY the named dimension(s), so one failed dimension can
  be re-run without redoing the other 47. (Partial answer to the resumability gap.)
- **`--skip=<keys>`** (existing) — skip named dimensions.
- **`--prod`** guard + prod path (added at Stage 0).

## ⚠ THE TWO TRAPS — validate by CONTENT and FRESHNESS, never by exit code or row count
- **A failed dimension leaves STALE rows that LOOK populated.** When `vs_top_hitters` failed, `pitch_log_pitcher_totals`
  still SHOWED **5,349 rows** for that `dimension_key` — left over from a PRE-v2 run, computed from OLD labels and OLD
  Stuff+ scores. **A row-count check would have passed.** → After ANY reclassification, verify a dimension by
  FRESHNESS (did *this* run write it?), never by row count.
- **The script EXITS 0 even when a dimension FAILED.** → grep the log for `FAILED` and for the per-dimension `ok`.
  A run was wrongly marked COMPLETE this way on 2026-08-29.

## RESUMABILITY OF THE CHAIN (know what a restart costs)
| step | resumable? | why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 `reclassify_prod.ts` | ✅ FULLY | keyset on PK + `is distinct from` guards + `_reclass_fix` upserted by PK. A re-run skips completed rows. |
| 3 `compute_pitch_log_stuff_plus.ts` | ❌ NO — and it is the costliest to lose | re-scores ALL rows matching the class version instead of filtering `stuff_plus IS NULL`. Every attempt costs the FULL runtime (~36 min staging, longer on prod), and a mid-run failure leaves **v2 labels + STALE scores**. FIX (future): two phases — score only NULLs, then ALWAYS recenter the full population (the recenter must see everything to shift each bucket to mean 100). |
| 4 `aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts` | ⚠ MANUALLY | the 48 dims are independent and `--skip=`/`--only=` exist, but you must pass the completed keys BY HAND. FIX (future): auto-skip dims already written for this run-generation. |

## ⚠ ENVIRONMENTAL FAILURES — do not confuse them with the gateway timeout
Three failures the same night were the LOCAL MACHINE sleeping / dropping its connection, NOT script defects:
staging insert `TypeError: fetch failed` · STEP 3 scoring died at 1,665,000/2,015,321 (~83%) with `read ECONNRESET` ·
STEP 4 first run died at 13/48, second at 39/48.
**Distinguishing symptom:** environmental failures die at DIFFERENT points each run; the `vs_top_hitters` failure died
at the SAME dimension with the SAME duration every time.
✅ **PROVEN PROCESS (Trevor): run long steps DETACHED and let them take however long they need,** with
`caffeinate -dimsu -w <pid>` tied to the process so the machine cannot sleep mid-run. Do not babysit, do not add
aggressive retry loops.

---

## 🏆 PHASE-H CLEANUP — WHAT MUST NEVER BE DROPPED
Phase H lists the Stuff+ `_reclass_*` temp tables as drop candidates. **EXCLUDE these — plus `team_war_snapshots`:**
- **`_reclass_result` (2,000,674 rows)** — the ONLY surviving record of the lost ANCHOR classifier's output. Its source
  code was scratchpad-only and is gone permanently. Now that we standardize on v2, this is the SOLE way to ever measure
  against the old process — the regression baseline for every future classifier change.
- **`_reclass_map` (37,101 rows)** — per-pitcher seed→label resolution; the evidence base for arsenal-conditioning research.
- **`_reclass_pf` (4,804 rows)** — per-pitcher primary-FB velo (the v2 staging run materialized 5,364 rows of it).
- **`team_war_snapshots`** — holds prod's irreplaceable 2025 champions (309 rows). NEVER drop.
Safe to drop: **`_reclass_fix`** (transient writer staging table only).

---
# 🧭 TRACK B — EXECUTION LESSONS FROM THE FIRST REAL RUN (staging + prod, 2026-08-29/30)
The 5-step chain has now been run END-TO-END on BOTH environments. Track B automates exactly this chain on ingest,
so every failure mode below WILL recur unattended unless Track B is built to handle it. This section is the
requirements list, written from what actually happened — not theory.

## ✅ WHAT WORKED (keep these properties)
- **Per-pitcher classification is deterministic.** Prod and staging produced an IDENTICAL label distribution to the
  tenth of a percent (4S 37.8 · SI 16.0 · SL 10.3 · GY 10.2 · CH 9.1 · CB 5.6 · SW 5.2 · FC 3.7 · SPL 2.1) and an
  IDENTICAL per-pitcher Stuff+ gate (mean 99.3 · p50 99.3 · p10 93.1 · p90 105.7). Two independent datasets, same
  numbers ⇒ the classifier + scorer are reproducible. **Track B should assert this gate after every run.**
- **A hard SIGN CHECK that refuses to write** caught nothing because nothing was wrong — but it is the reason we can
  TRUST the armHB convention on both envs (18/18 buckets, twice). **Keep abort-before-write invariants.**
- **`is distinct from` + keyset + per-batch commit** made step 1 resumable and cheap to retry.
- **Backups before every destructive step** (`_v2_prechain_backup`, `_hm_prestep5_backup`, `_pm_prestep5_backup`) made
  the whole chain reversible. **Track B must snapshot before it writes, every run.**
- **Halt-on-failure between steps** stopped a quoting bug from cascading (it died before writing anything).

## ❌ WHAT BROKE — AND WHAT TRACK B MUST DO ABOUT IT
1. **STEP 3 DOES NOT RESUME.** `compute_pitch_log_stuff_plus.ts:185` re-scores every row matching the class version
   rather than filtering `stuff_plus IS NULL`, so each attempt costs the FULL runtime (staging 35.7 min, prod 29.9)
   and a mid-run failure leaves **v2 labels + STALE scores** — the one state that must never exist.
   → **TRACK B FIX: two phases — (a) score only `stuff_plus IS NULL`, (b) ALWAYS recenter across the FULL population**
   (the recenter needs every row to shift each bucket to mean 100, which is why naive resume is wrong).
2. **`--direct` REMOVES THE FAILURE SIGNAL.** `statement_timeout=0` + long `query_timeout` defeats the gateway's ~125s
   cut (required: `vs_top_hitters` needs 151-255s) but a dropped pooler connection then becomes an INFINITE HANG.
   Prod stage 4 sat **39 minutes with no output**, no active query, no locks. Nothing retried because nothing failed.
   → **TRACK B FIX: `keepAlive: true`, a FINITE `query_timeout` (~20-30 min, sized off the slowest dimension), and
   per-dimension progress logging.** Unattended automation CANNOT have an unbounded wait.
3. **EXIT CODE 0 ≠ SUCCESS.** `aggregate_pitch_log_dimensions.ts` exits 0 even when a dimension FAILED, and it HALTS
   on that failure so the 8 dimensions behind it never run. A run was wrongly marked COMPLETE this way.
   → **TRACK B FIX: validate by CONTENT (grep for the per-item success line + `FAILED`), never by exit code.**
4. **"ROWS EXIST" ≠ "ROWS ARE FRESH".** When `vs_top_hitters` failed, its table still showed 5,349 rows from the
   PRE-v2 run. A row-count check PASSES on stale data.
   → **TRACK B FIX: stamp a run/version marker on aggregate rows and verify FRESHNESS, not count.**
5. **`select *` VIEWS GO STALE SILENTLY.** Prod's `pitch_log_corrected` was frozen at 94/99 columns and did not expose
   `classification_version`, so the scorer hard-failed on prod while passing on staging. `create or replace` cannot
   fix it — it needs drop+create.
   → **TRACK B FIX: after ANY `ALTER TABLE pitch_log ADD COLUMN`, rebuild the view. Assert the view's column count
   matches the base table before the chain starts.**
6. **A LABEL CHANGE INVALIDATES EVERYTHING BELOW IT.** The §4.5 gyro floor moved 6-8% of breaking-ball volume, so every
   mix-dependent baseline/SD/percentile was invalid until regenerated.
   → **TRACK B FIX: steps 1→5 are ONE transaction-of-work. Never emit "done" between them.**
7. **ORDERING IS LOAD-BEARING AND WAS WRONG IN THE DOCS.** C26 must follow C27 (it reads `ncaa_averages` and falls back
   to hardcoded defaults SILENTLY when fields are missing); C29 must precede C28 (10 NJCAA rows are still tagged
   `division='D1'` and both C28 producers filter on it). Migration order for `team_season_stats` is by DEPENDENCY, not
   timestamp — the filenames sort wrong and fn-before-ALTER empties the table.
8. **UNORDERED `.range()` SILENTLY DROPS/DUPES ROWS.** Found in 6+ producers. A blanket `order("id")` is NOT the fix —
   `pitch_log_*_totals`, `player_season_defense` and `player_season_baserunning` have NO `id` column.
   → **TRACK B FIX: per-table PK map; refuse to paginate an unregistered table.**
9. **NEW-ROW CREATION WAS UNGATED.** `derive_masters_from_pitchlog` spread invented Master rows into the same upsert as
   the patches. The Masters are the TruMedia source of truth; a pitch-log-only row is a half-populated player.
   → **TRACK B FIX: never create Master rows implicitly. Opt-in only (`--create-new`), default OFF.**
10. **ENV GUARDS WERE MISSING OR WRONG.** One market script hardcoded `.env.local` (would resync STAGING while
    reporting success on a prod run); two others had NO guard at all and would write prod with zero opt-in; one had a
    STAGING build-id as its default scope, returning 0 rows on prod.
    → **TRACK B FIX: double-keyed guard everywhere — the URL and the `--prod` flag must AGREE, or refuse to run.**
11. **SEASON KEYS DIFFER BY PURPOSE.** 2026 = completed season (descriptive WAR), 2027 = projections. A query on the
    wrong season returns a misleading ZERO — this produced a false "staging has no WAR data" alarm.
    → **TRACK B FIX: every gate query must state its season explicitly and assert a non-zero denominator.**
12. **MACHINE SLEEP KILLED LONG RUNS.** Distinguish: environmental failures die at a DIFFERENT point each run;
    structural ones die at the SAME place with the SAME duration. Run detached with `caffeinate -dimsu -w <pid>`.

# 📐 TRACK B — EVERY VALUE THE CHAIN COMPUTES WITH (canonical list + where it lives)
Track B must not re-derive or guess ANY of these. Where a value lives in code, the code is authoritative and this is
the pointer + the current value so drift is detectable. Full detail: `docs/STUFF_PLUS_EXACT_VALUES.md`.

## STAGE 1 — CLASSIFIER (`src/savant/lib/stuffPlusClassifierV2.ts`) — 95.2% per-pitch / 95.3% arsenal-mix
Conventions: `armHB = (hand==="R" ? hb : -hb)` · `rr = ivb - |armHB|` · `gap = primaryFB_velo - pitch_velo`.
`primaryFB_velo` = mean velo of the pitcher's raw FA/SI if ≥3 such pitches, else mean of all his pitches.
**Per-pitch SEED (evaluation order is load-bearing):**
```
1  ivb <= -8  AND armhb < 4  AND gap >= 4            -> Curveball
2  armhb <= -12 AND ivb > -8 AND ivb <= 6            -> Sweeper
3  ivb >= 5 AND gap 2..7 AND armhb <= 2              -> Cutter
4  gap < 4:  rr > 4 -> 4S FB | rr < -4 -> Sinker | else -> FBSTRIP
5  |armhb| < 5 AND ivb -4..4                         -> Gyro Slider
6  armhb >= 5:  spin < 1400 -> Splitter | else -> Change-up      ★ FLOOR = 5
7  else                                               -> Slider
```
**Per-pitcher:** MERGE `|Δarmhb|<4 & |Δivb|<3.5 & |Δvelo|<2.5` **+ fastball-family guard (never merge differing
4S/Sinker/FBSTRIP seeds)** · FBSTRIP resolve: cluster mean `rr >= 0` -> 4S else Sinker · small-sample `<150` = means
only · ANCHOR = `n>=60 OR n>=0.10*total` · **§4.5 GYRO FLOOR: cluster labeled Slider with mean armHB >= -3 -> Gyro
Slider, applied BEFORE the step-4 backfill** · backfill fold: `moveDist<5 & |Δvelo|<3` into a strictly-LARGER anchor,
else non-anchor -> `needs_review` · tiebreaks: gyro/curve `|ar|<5 & -8<iv<-4` -> gap<=8 Gyro / >=10 Curve; CT/SL
ride-floor `iv>=5` -> Cutter.
⛔ NEVER re-derive: `rr > -1.7` FBSTRIP cut and the "arsenal rule" are LOGGED NEGATIVE RESULTS (both lose ~1pp).

## STAGE 2 — POP BASELINE (`pitcher_stuff_plus_ncaa`, per pitch_type × hand, **armHB**, D1-only)
Producer `scripts/derive_stuff_plus_pop_baseline.ts`. Stores mean + sd for: velocity, ivb, hb(armHB), rel_height,
rel_side, extension, spin, velo_diff(gap). **Hard sign check: arm-side (4S/SI/CH/SPL) POSITIVE and glove-side
(SL/SW/CB) NEGATIVE in BOTH hands, or it refuses to write.** MANDATORY after any reclass (the gyro floor moves 6-8% of
breaking-ball volume).

## STAGE 3 — THE 9 STUFF+ EQUATIONS (`src/savant/lib/stuffPlusEngine.ts`) — `score = 100 + weighted*20`
`z=(x-μ)/sd` · `zAbs=|x-μ|/sd` · `zMax=(max(x,μ)-μ)/sd`. **hb is armHB** (the `hbSign` multiplier was folded out in e5dec2f).
```
4S FB     0.30 z(velo) +0.25 z(ivb) +0.15 zAbs(armHB) +0.10 zAbs(relH) +0.05 zAbs(relS) +0.10 z(ext) +0.05 z(spin)
Sinker    0.30 z(velo) -0.20 z(ivb) +0.30 z(armHB)    +0.05 zAbs(relH) +0.05 zAbs(relS) +0.10 z(ext)
Cutter    0.30 zMax(velo) +0.15 z(ivb) -0.25 z(armHB) +0.05 zAbs(relH) +0.05 zAbs(relS) +0.10 z(ext) +0.10 z(spin)
Gyro      0.30 zMax(velo) +0.15(-z(ivb)) +0.25((hb_sd-|armHB|)/hb_sd) +0.10 z(fbGap) +0.05 zAbs(relH) +0.05 zAbs(relS) +0.10 z(ext)
Slider    0.15 zMax(velo) +0.10(-z(ivb)) -0.35 z(armHB) +0.10 z(fbGap) +0.05 zAbs(relH) +0.05 zAbs(relS) +0.10 z(ext) +0.10 z(spin)
Sweeper   0.10 zMax(velo) -0.10 z(ivb) -0.40 z(armHB) +0.10 z(fbGap) +0.05 zAbs(relH) +0.05 zAbs(relS) +0.10 z(ext) +0.10 z(spin)
Curveball 0.10 zMax(velo) -0.30 z(ivb) -0.15 z(armHB) +0.10 z(fbGap) +0.05 zAbs(relH) +0.05 zAbs(relS) +0.10 z(ext) +0.15 z(spin)
Change-up 0.15 z(fbChVeloDiff) -0.20 z(ivb) +0.35 z(armHB) +0.05 zAbs(relH) +0.05 zAbs(relS) +0.10 z(ext) +0.10 zAbs(spin)
Splitter  0.10 zMax(velo) -0.20 z(ivb) +0.25 z(armHB) +0.05 zAbs(relH) +0.05 zAbs(relS) +0.10 z(ext) +0.25(-z(spin))
```
Then **RECENTER each (pitch_type × hand) bucket to mean 100** — per-pitcher UNWEIGHTED, outliers (>140 / <60) excluded
from the calibration (`stuffPlusEngine.ts:450`). Per-pitch scores clamped to [40,160] BEFORE recenter.
Row filters: drop if `ivb` or `hb` NULL; drop if `ivb=0 AND hb=0 AND pitches<5`; drop if `pitches<5`.

## STAGE 4/5 — DOWNSTREAM CONSTANTS
Conference Stuff+ (V2, canonical) = pitch-weighted `Σ(pitcher Stuff+ × pitch count)/Σ(pitch count)`, FULL season.
`HTP = OPR + 1.25(Stuff+ - 100) + 0.75(100 - run_env)`.
`wRC+ = ((0.011 + 0.691·OBP + 0.235·SLG)/0.3782)·100`
`oWAR = ((((wRC+-100)/100)·PA·0.3994) + (PA/600·21.22)) / 13.1`
`pRV+ = 100 + 100·(6.913 - projRA9)/6.913`, `projRA9 = (3.847 - 0.231·K9 + 0.509·BB9 + 1.486·HR9)·1.137`
`pWAR = (((pRV+ -100)/100)·(IP/9)·6.915 + (IP/9·1.92)) / 13.1`
`total_hitter_war = o_war + d_war + bsr_war`
**RPW = 13.1** — VERIFIED stored in BOTH envs' `model_config`: `owar_runs_per_win=13.1`, `pwar_runs_per_win=13.1`
(and present 4× in the live `refresh_composite_war()` on prod). Do NOT hardcode 10.
56-game proration: `games_played_est ≈ team IP/9`, `factor = 56/games_played_est` capped **0.7–1.5**.
⚠ `computeAndStoreScores` reads baselines from `ncaa_averages` and falls back to HARDCODED defaults **silently** when a
field is missing — so C27 MUST run before C26, and Track B must assert the baselines exist before scoring.

## GATES TRACK B MUST ASSERT EVERY RUN
per-pitcher Stuff+ **mean 99.3 · p50 99.3 · p10 93.1 · p90 105.7** · every (type × hand) bucket recenters to **100.0**
· `needs_review ≈ 8.1%` · label distribution 4S 37.8 / SI 16.0 / SL 10.3 / GY 10.2 / CH 9.1 / CB 5.6 / SW 5.2 / FC 3.7
/ SPL 2.1 · `unscored = 0`.

# ✅ PROVEN ON PROD — THE STUFF+ CHAIN, WHAT IT PRODUCED, AND WHY IT IS CORRECT (2026-08-30)
The full 5-step chain has now run END-TO-END on BOTH environments. This is the record of what worked, the values it
produced, and the EVIDENCE that it is right — not just that it completed.

## THE RESULT — PROD AND STAGING AGREE ON INDEPENDENT DATA
| check | STAGING | PROD | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| pitches classified | 2,015,321 | 2,013,005 | both = every `is_data=true` row |
| label distribution | 4S 37.8 · SI 16.0 · SL 10.3 · GY 10.2 · CH 9.1 · CB 5.6 · SW 5.2 · FC 3.7 · SPL 2.1 | **IDENTICAL** | deterministic |
| needs_review | 8.1% | 8.1% | identical |
| per-pitcher Stuff+ | mean 99.3 · p50 99.3 · p10 93.1 · p90 105.7 | **mean 99.3 · p50 99.3 · p10 93.1 · p90 105.7** | identical |
| bucket recenter | every (type×hand) = 100.0 | every (type×hand) = 100.0 | correct by construction |
| unscored rows | 0 | 0 | full coverage |
| armHB sign check | 18/18 buckets | 18/18 buckets | convention PROVEN twice |
| Master avg stuff_plus | 98.82 | 98.86 | consistent |
**WHY THIS IS THE PROOF:** two DIFFERENT pitch populations, run through the same committed classifier + scorer,
produced the same distribution to the tenth of a percent AND the same per-pitcher percentiles. That cannot happen by
chance if anything upstream (labels, baseline, convention, recenter) were wrong. Independent replication, not a
self-check.

## THE VALUES IT USED (canonical; see the "TRACK B — EVERY VALUE THE CHAIN COMPUTES WITH" block)
Classifier v2 @ **95.2% per-pitch / 95.3% arsenal-mix** vs the anchor ground truth (full 2,000,674-pitch population).
Three shipped fixes, each MEASURED not guessed: offspeed **armHB floor = 5** (gyro p99 4.7 vs offspeed p1 5.3, a clean
empty gap) · **fastball-family merge guard** (91.69%→93.01%, 4S↔Sinker errors −41%) · **§4.5 gyro floor = −3 applied
BEFORE the backfill** (95.1%→95.2% AND fragmentation 7%→5%, strictly better on both). Two NEGATIVE results recorded so
they are never rebuilt: `rr > −1.7` and the "arsenal rule" (both lose ~1pp). Verified-optimal, do not touch:
Sweeper/Slider armHB −12 (1.0% error) · Gyro/Slider armHB −5. **RPW = 13.1**, verified stored in BOTH envs'
`model_config` (`owar_runs_per_win` / `pwar_runs_per_win`) and present 4× in prod's live `refresh_composite_war()`.

## WHY EACH SAFEGUARD MATTERED (all of these fired or would have)
- **Abort-before-write sign check** — the reason armHB is TRUSTED on both envs rather than assumed.
- **Backups before every destructive step** (`_v2_prechain_backup` 2.58M/2.58M rows, `_hm_prestep5_backup` 30,025/30,027,
  `_pm_prestep5_backup` 29,238/29,239) — made the whole chain reversible; used to disprove a suspected regression.
- **Halt-on-failure between steps** — stopped a quoting bug before it wrote anything.
- **`--direct` for stage 4** — `vs_top_hitters` needs 151–255s and the HTTP gateway cuts at ~125s, so it would have
  failed 100% on prod AND halted the 8 dimensions behind it.
- **New-row creation gated OFF** — prevented inventing half-populated Master rows. Confirmed 0 new rows on both envs.
- **Phase-gate "value landed, not just ran"** — caught that `pull_air` went 0 → 4,366 on prod (C23 subsumed by C25).

## ⚠ THE THREE TRAPS THAT PRODUCED FALSE ALARMS (check these before reporting a problem)
1. **Season keys.** 2026 = completed/descriptive · 2027 = projections. Wrong season ⇒ misleading ZERO. Caused a false
   "staging has no WAR data" alarm.
2. **Different denominators.** A count across ALL seasons vs `Season=2026 AND division='D1'` are not comparable —
   this produced a false "trackman_pitches regression" (it was 0 before AND after; C24 populates it, and it had not run).
3. **"Rows exist" ≠ "rows fresh."** A failed aggregation leaves stale rows that PASS a count check.
**RULE: compare like-for-like against the BACKUP before calling anything a regression.**

---
# ✅ C24 `trackman_pitches` — PITCH_LOG-FIRST for D1, LEGACY only for JUCO (fixed + applied to prod 2026-08-30)
**THE BUG:** `backfill_trackman_pitches_pitching_master.ts` summed `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs.pitches` — the LEGACY
CSV-fed table — to set `trackman_pitches`. That column is the **TrackMan sample-size gate for the Stuff+ display
qualifier**, so it MUST come from the same lane as the Stuff+ values it gates. Same defect shape as
`computeNcaaAverages`: the VALUE moved to the pitch_log lane but a supporting COUNT was left on the legacy table.
**MEASURED ON PROD — the two sources disagree badly:** of 5,367 shared pitchers only **638 (11.9%) were IDENTICAL**;
the legacy table **UNDERCOUNTS by ~12.1 pitches/pitcher** (2,507,664 vs 2,572,528 total, ~65k pitches missing).
An undercount pushes borderline thin-sample arms the WRONG way on the leaderboard.

**THE FIX (Trevor: "keep juco and true ncaa d1 separate"):**
- **D1 → `pitch_log_pitcher_totals.total_pitches` at `dimension_key='all'`** (5,509 pitchers).
- **JUCO → `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs` fallback.** JUCO has **NO pitch logs at all** — that is the 7,013 vs 5,509
  pitcher gap. Never mix the two lanes; never "fix" JUCO by pointing it at pitch_log.
Implementation: new `pageAll2()` helper (ordered pagination + `dimension_key` filter); pitch_log values OVERRIDE the
legacy sums where present, legacy remains only where pitch_log has nothing.

**DRY RUN (prod):** `pitch_log (D1): 5,509 pitchers · OVERRODE 5,509 with pitch_log · 1,646 remain legacy-sourced
(JUCO / no pitch log) · would change 5,618 Master rows (5,376 NULL, 242 different)`. Values demonstrably changed vs the
legacy version (e.g. `13108257 314→375`, `14110428 1016→685`, `19295025 1280→1435`) — proof the legacy source was wrong.
**APPLIED:** 5,618 rows written.
**PHASE GATE PASSED:** `D1 5,375/5,375` · `NJCAA_D1 2,695/2,695` · `D2 1/1` — 100% coverage, each from the correct lane.

---
# ✅ C27 → C26 APPLIED TO PROD 2026-08-30 (order is load-bearing — C27 FIRST)
## C27 `computeNcaaAverages` — ✅ APPLIED
`hittersUsed 5,340 · pitchersUsed 5,375 · fieldsWritten 72 · modelConfigRowsWritten 40 · ncaa_averages 2026 = 1 row`
**`p_ncaa_avg_stuff_plus` 101.8341 → 100.0141** · `p_sd_stuff_plus = 5.04577` · `p_ncaa_avg_whiff_pct = 23.3673`.
★ **The Stuff+ mean landing at 100.01 is independent CONFIRMATION that the recenter survived the whole chain**
(score → aggregate → Master rollup). The old 101.83 came from the legacy-weighted lane.
⚠ **C27 MUST PRECEDE C26.** `computeAndStoreScores.ts:206-211,:249` reads baselines from `ncaa_averages` and, for any
MISSING field, falls back to HARDCODED defaults **SILENTLY** (`:212-215`). Wrong order ⇒ quietly wrong power ratings
with no error. This ordering was inverted in the docs and is now corrected everywhere.

## C26 `computeAndStoreScores` (propagate=false) — ✅ APPLIED
`pitchers 8,071 updated, 0 errors · hitters 8,244 updated, 0 errors` · `propagate=false` honored on BOTH sides
(**`player_predictions` untouched** — it is Phase F that repopulates those).
🛑 **BUG FIXED BEFORE RUNNING:** `scripts/_run_store_no_propagate.ts` had **NO env guard** and its banner claimed
"staging" while `--env-file .env.production.local` would happily write PROD. Added the standard double-keyed guard
(URL and `--prod` must AGREE) and made the banner print the resolved env. Refuse path verified:
running against the prod env WITHOUT `--prod` now aborts with `✗ URL is PROD but --prod was not passed`.

## PATTERN WORTH NOTING (3 for 3 on the last three steps)
C24 was sourcing from the LEGACY lane · C26's runner had no guard and a banner that LIED about the target DB · C27 was
documented in the wrong ORDER. **Every one was caught by inspecting the step before running it, not after.** Do not
run a remaining step (C28/C29, D, E, F) without first checking: (1) which LANE does it read from — pitch_log or the
legacy PSP-I? (2) does it have a working double-keyed `--prod` guard? (3) is its position in the sequence right, and
does anything it depends on fall back to defaults SILENTLY?

---
# 🛑 C28 PRE-FLIGHT — FINDINGS (2026-08-30). RUN NOTHING UNTIL THESE ARE RESOLVED.
Ran the 5-question pre-flight (LANE · GUARD · ORDER · SILENT FALLBACK · BACKUP) against PROD. Three blockers found.

## ✅ LANE — CLEAN (both producers are on the correct lane)
`compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus.ts` reads `ncaa_averages` (refreshed by C27 ✅) + `"Pitching Master"` D1 WHIP/IP
(refreshed by C26 ✅) + `"Conference Stats"`. `derive_conf_opr_htp.ts` reads `"Park Factors".rg_factor` +
`"Conference Stats"` + `"Teams Table"`. **Neither touches the legacy `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs`.** Also confirms the
C27-before-C26-before-C28 ordering is right: C28 consumes what both of those produced.

## 🔴 BLOCKER 1 — NEITHER PRODUCER HAS ANY `--prod` GUARD
`grep -c "trbvxuoliwrfowibatkm\|--prod"` = **0** for BOTH `compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus.ts` and
`derive_conf_opr_htp.ts`. `--env-file .env.production.local` writes PROD with **zero opt-in** — the same defect
already fixed in `_run_store_no_propagate.ts` (C26) and the four market scripts. **FIX BEFORE RUNNING:** add the
standard double-keyed guard (URL and `--prod` must AGREE) and verify the refuse path.

## 🔴 BLOCKER 2 — NO BACKUP EXISTS ON PROD, AND THE G-GATE REFERENCE DOES NOT EXIST EITHER
`_confstats_backup` = **ABSENT** on prod · `_confstats_backup_preassembly` = **ABSENT** on prod.
C28 is a DESTRUCTIVE rebuild of the conference baselines that every projection's competition-translation consumes.
**FIX: `create table _confstats_backup as select * from "Conference Stats"` on prod FIRST.**
⚠ The documented **G-GATE** (re-run bucketA on STAGING, diff vs `_confstats_backup_preassembly`, require 0.0000) has
**NEVER been executed** — it was deferred 2026-08-21 ("no staging conn"). The preassembly baseline it compares against
does not exist on prod, so the gate must be run on STAGING, where the artifact belongs.

## 🔴 BLOCKER 3 — `Park Factors.rg_factor_seasonal` IS EMPTY ON PROD (0/309) — SILENT-FALLBACK RISK
| | PROD | STAGING |
|---|---|---|
| Park Factors 2026 rows | 309 | 308 |
| `rg_factor` | **309 ✅** | 308 |
| `rg_factor_seasonal` | **0 ❌** | **308 ✅** |
`derive_conf_opr_htp.ts:10` reads **`rg_factor`**, which IS populated on prod — so C28 will run. BUT prod is missing
the entire `*_seasonal` set that staging has (its producer, E2 `backfill_park_factors_seasonal.ts`, is hardwired to
STAGING and has never run on prod — audit G13/H4). **Decide BEFORE C28 whether the conference run-environment should
use the seasonal factors** (as staging effectively does downstream) or the flat `rg_factor`. If prod and staging use
different park inputs, their conference HTP/OPR will diverge and the staging-match gate becomes meaningless.

## CURRENT PROD STATE (what C28 is meant to fill)
`Conference Stats` 2026 = **42 rows** (D1 30 · NJCAA_D1 10 · D2 2 after C29) ·
**`hitter_talent_plus` 0/42** · **`run_env_factor` 0/42** ← C28 fills these · `Stuff_plus` **42/42** (pre-existing copy;
audit G14 notes D1 `Stuff_plus` has NO committed producer — confirm what refreshes it or it stays stale while
everything around it is rebuilt).

## ORDERED EXECUTION (only after 1-3 are resolved)
1. Add `--prod` guards to both producers; verify refuse paths.
2. `create table _confstats_backup as select * from "Conference Stats"` on PROD; verify row count = 42.
3. Run the **G-GATE on STAGING** (bucketA re-run vs `_confstats_backup_preassembly`, require diff 0.0000). ABORT if not.
4. Resolve the `rg_factor` vs `rg_factor_seasonal` decision.
5. PROD: **PASTE** `conf_stats_bucketA_assembly.sql` in the SQL editor — **NEVER `--linked`** (`supabase/config.toml`
   currently names a THIRD project ref `kfkuhdmpchxyffmnowgj`; run `supabase projects list` first).
6. `compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus.ts --apply --prod` → `derive_conf_opr_htp.ts --apply --prod`.
7. **PHASE GATE:** `hitter_talent_plus` and `run_env_factor` go 0/42 → populated; D1 stays 30 and NJCAA_D1 stays 10;
   conference Stuff+/HTP compare sanely to staging.
⛔ **NEVER run `populate-conf-stats` on prod** — it overwrites the hand-calibrated JUCO overlay. Different script,
confusingly similar name, not part of C28.

---
# 🔴→✅ CONFERENCE STUFF+ WAS ON THE LEGACY LANE — FIXED 2026-08-30 (critical for Track B)
## THE FINDING (audit G14 said "no committed producer" — that was WRONG)
`src/savant/lib/conferenceStuffPlusV2.ts` **IS** the producer of `"Conference Stats".Stuff_plus`. But it read
per-pitcher scored rows from **`pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs`** — the **LEGACY CSV lane**. The v2 chain writes Stuff+ to
`pitch_log.stuff_plus` and rolls it up to `"Pitching Master".stuff_plus`; it **NEVER writes PSP-I**, so PSP-I holds
**PRE-v2 scores**. Conference Stuff+ would therefore have been built from stale numbers.
**WHY THIS ONE MATTERS MOST:** Conference Stuff+ IS the competition-translation lever — a player projected INTO a
conference is scored against that conference's Stuff+/HTP. A stale value silently biases **every projection**.
This is the THIRD instance of the same shape (C24 `trackman_pitches`, `computeNcaaAverages` weighting, now this):
**the VALUE moved to the pitch_log lane but a supporting INPUT was left on legacy.**

## THE FIX
Read the rolled-up per-pitcher value and its pitch count straight from `"Pitching Master"`:
`Σ("Pitching Master".stuff_plus × trackman_pitches) / Σ(trackman_pitches)` — definition unchanged (pitch-weighted,
full season). Both inputs are **pitch_log-sourced for D1** (C25 writes `stuff_plus`, C24 writes `trackman_pitches`)
and correctly **fall back to the legacy lane for JUCO**, so ONE formula stays right for BOTH divisions without ever
mixing lanes. Filters `stuff_plus IS NOT NULL AND trackman_pitches > 0`.

## VERIFIED ON STAGING (values are sane and the D1/JUCO relationship is correct)
`D1 30 conferences avg 99.16 (range 92.9–107.3)` · `NJCAA_D1 10 avg 96.00 (92.0–100.7)` · `D2 2 avg 93.00`.
D1 centring near 100 with JUCO clearly below it is the expected "conference pitching depth" signal.

## ⚠ GAP FOUND WHILE TESTING — `calculateConferenceStuffPlusV2` IGNORES `dryRun`
It was called with `{ dryRun: true }` and **wrote anyway** ("5. write to Conference Stats"). The option is not
implemented. Benign here (staging needed the refresh and the values are correct) but **there is no way to preview this
producer**. Before running it on PROD: either add real dry-run support, or rely on `_confstats_backup` (already created
on prod, 162 rows / 42 for 2026) as the rollback.
## TRACK B REQUIREMENT
Track B's conference-stats stage must compute Conference Stuff+ from the **pitch_log lane via Pitching Master**, never
from `pitcher_stuff_plus_inputs`, and must keep the D1 / JUCO fallback split intact.

# ✅ G-GATE EXECUTED AND PASSED (staging, 2026-08-30) — deferred since 2026-08-21, now done
Method: snapshot `"Conference Stats"` 2026 → `_ggate_before`, re-run `scripts/sql/conf_stats_bucketA_assembly.sql`,
then diff EVERY numeric column joined on `(conference_id, season)`.
**RESULT: 77 numeric columns compared · 0 changed · worst absolute diff 0.000000.**
✅ **The bucketA assembly is IDEMPOTENT** — re-running it does not drift values. Safe to run on prod.
(Reference table `_confstats_backup_preassembly` exists on staging: 162 rows, 42 for 2026.)

# 📊 PROD "Conference Stats" 2026 (D1, 30 rows) — WHAT IS FILLED vs WHAT C28 FILLS
**FILLED (66 cols):** AVG · OBP · ISO · ERA · FIP · WHIP · K9 · BB9 · HR9 · `Overall_Power_Rating` · `WRC_plus` ·
`ba_plus` · `ba_power_rating` · `Stuff_plus` · … (all inputs C28 needs are present)
**EMPTY (13 cols) — exactly C28's outputs, so there is NO partial state:**
`era_plus` `fip_plus` `k9_plus` `bb9_plus` `hr9_plus` `whip_plus` ← `compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus`
`hitter_talent_plus` `run_env_factor` ← `derive_conf_opr_htp`
`OPS` `SLG` `slg_plus` `pitcher_ev_score` `pitcher_iz_score` ← bucketA assembly

## 🛑 STALE-VALUE CATCH — `Stuff_plus` IS 30/30 FILLED ON PROD **BUT IT IS PRE-v2**
The Conference Stuff+ lane fix was applied and verified on **STAGING only**. Prod's `"Conference Stats".Stuff_plus`
still holds the value computed BEFORE the v2 chain — a fully-populated column that PASSES any count check while being
stale. Third occurrence today of "looks populated, isn't fresh".
→ **C28 ON PROD NEEDS ONE MORE STEP THAN THE DOCS LIST:** run the FIXED `conferenceStuffPlusV2`
(`Σ(Pitching Master.stuff_plus × trackman_pitches)/Σ(trackman_pitches)`) to refresh `Stuff_plus` from the pitch_log
lane, ALONGSIDE the two producers that fill the 13 empty columns. Otherwise the competition-translation lever stays
stale while everything around it is rebuilt.
→ Staging reference after the fix: D1 30 conf avg **99.16** (92.9–107.3) · NJCAA_D1 10 avg **96.00** · D2 2 avg 93.00.

# 🧩 C28 BUCKET MAP — WHO WRITES WHAT, AND WHY `Stuff_plus` FELL THROUGH THE GAP (2026-08-30)
`scripts/sql/conf_stats_bucketA_assembly.sql:12` states the split verbatim:
`SCOPE: writes ONLY Bucket A (rates/env+/WRC_plus). Bucket B (OPR/Stuff_plus/run_env_factor/…)`

| bucket | producer | columns it writes |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | `conf_stats_bucketA_assembly.sql` (PASTE in SQL editor) | `OBP` `ISO` `SLG` `OPS` `obp_plus` `slg_plus` `iso_plus` `WHIP` `FIP` `ERA` + rates + `WRC_plus` |
| **B (pitching env+)** | `compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus.ts` | `era_plus` `fip_plus` `k9_plus` `bb9_plus` `hr9_plus` `whip_plus` |
| **B (OPR/HTP)** | `derive_conf_opr_htp.ts` | `run_env_factor` `offensive_power_rating` `hitter_talent_plus` |
| **B (Stuff+)** | ⚠ **`conferenceStuffPlusV2.ts` — a SEPARATE producer, NOT part of the documented C28 steps** | `Stuff_plus` |

## ★ THE GAP, STATED PLAINLY
`Stuff_plus` belongs to **Bucket B** but is written by **NEITHER** bucketA **NOR** `derive_conf_opr_htp`. It has its own
producer that the C28 runbook never listed. So:
**`Stuff_plus` is the ONLY Conference Stats metric that is BOTH (a) stale on prod (pre-v2) AND (b) not refreshed by any
of the three documented C28 steps.** Every other filled column is either rewritten by Bucket A / Bucket B, or is a
source input already refreshed by C24 / C26 / C27.
Because it is 30/30 populated it PASSES every count check while being stale — and it is the competition-translation
lever, so a stale value silently biases EVERY projection of a player INTO a conference.

## ✅ C28 ON PROD — THE CORRECTED FOUR-STEP ORDER (the runbook had three)
0. **Backups already created on prod:** `_confstats_backup` (162 rows / 42 for 2026) · `_parkfactors_backup` (615).
1. **PASTE** `conf_stats_bucketA_assembly.sql` in the SQL editor. ⛔ **NEVER `--linked`** — `supabase/config.toml`
   names a THIRD project ref (`kfkuhdmpchxyffmnowgj`). Run `supabase projects list` first.
   ✅ **G-GATE PASSED 2026-08-30** — re-run on staging diffed 77 numeric columns: **0 changed, worst 0.000000**, so the
   assembly is IDEMPOTENT and cannot drift prod's values.
2. `npx tsx --env-file=.env.production.local scripts/compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus.ts --apply --prod`
   ✅ `--prod` guard ADDED 2026-08-30 (it had none); refuse path verified.
3. `npx tsx --env-file=.env.production.local scripts/derive_conf_opr_htp.ts --apply --prod`
   ✅ `--prod` guard ADDED 2026-08-30 (it had none); refuse path verified.
   Reads `"Park Factors".rg_factor` — **309/309 populated on prod** (it does NOT read `rg_factor_seasonal`, which is
   empty on prod; that is E2's job and NOT a C28 blocker).
4. **★ NEW STEP — refresh `Stuff_plus`:** run the FIXED `conferenceStuffPlusV2`
   (`Σ("Pitching Master".stuff_plus × trackman_pitches) / Σ(trackman_pitches)`).
   ⚠ **It IGNORES `dryRun` and writes regardless — no preview exists.** Rollback = `_confstats_backup`.
⛔ **NEVER run `populate-conf-stats` on prod** — different script, confusingly similar name, overwrites the
hand-calibrated JUCO overlay.

## PHASE GATE AFTER C28 (verify VALUES, not just that it ran)
- The 13 previously-EMPTY columns become populated: `era_plus` `fip_plus` `k9_plus` `bb9_plus` `hr9_plus` `whip_plus`
  `hitter_talent_plus` `run_env_factor` `OPS` `SLG` `slg_plus` `pitcher_ev_score` `pitcher_iz_score`.
- `Stuff_plus` CHANGES from its stale pre-v2 value (compare BEFORE/AFTER — do not just count non-nulls).
- Division split holds: **D1 = 30 · NJCAA_D1 = 10 · D2 = 2**.
- Staging reference shape after the same fix: D1 avg **99.16** (92.9–107.3) · NJCAA_D1 avg **96.00** · D2 avg 93.00.

# ✅ C28 APPLIED TO PROD 2026-08-30 — all four steps, phase gate PASSED
Ran via the DIRECT pg session with the prod ref asserted (equivalent to pasting; **never `--linked`**).
BEFORE snapshot kept as `_c28_before` (alongside `_confstats_backup`).
1. **bucketA assembly** → `OPS` `SLG` `slg_plus` 0/30 → **29/30**
2. **`compute_conf_pitcher_env_plus --apply --prod`** → **30 conf rows**, 0 skipped.
   SANITY (correct direction): SEC ERA 5.82 → era+ **105** · Ivy 5.20 → **117** · HR9 SEC 1.62 → hr9+ **68**
   (SEC allows more HR ⇒ env+ <100) · Ivy 0.70 → **156**.
3. **`derive_conf_opr_htp --apply --prod`** → **30 rows**. e.g. Big 12 HTP 120.4 → **121** · MWC 98.8 → 97.8.
4. **★ `conferenceStuffPlusV2` (FIXED lane)** → **31 rows written**.

## ★ THE `Stuff_plus` CATCH WAS REAL — this is why step 4 exists
**D1 `Stuff_plus`: 101.17 → 99.15, with 30/30 rows CHANGED.** Prod now matches staging's **99.16**.
Following the runbook's three steps would have left it at the stale pre-v2 **101.17** while everything around it was
rebuilt — and a count check would have shown **30/30 populated and PASSED**. Because Conference Stuff+ is the
competition-translation lever, that stale value would have silently biased EVERY projection of a player into a conference.
Division relationship holds and matches staging: **D1 99.15 · NJCAA_D1 96.00 · D2 93.00**.

## PHASE GATE RESULT (D1, all were 0/30 before)
`era_plus 30` `fip_plus 30` `k9_plus 30` `whip_plus 30` `hitter_talent_plus 30` `run_env_factor 30` ✅
`OPS 29` `SLG 29` ⚠ · `pitcher_ev_score 0` ⚠

## ⚠ TWO LOOSE ENDS — NOT resolved, do not assume benign
1. **`OPS`/`SLG`/`slg_plus` = 29/30**, one conference short. Probable cause: a conference with no qualifying hitters,
   but **UNVERIFIED**. Identify the missing conference before trusting conference hitting rates for it.
2. **`pitcher_ev_score` = 0/30 and `pitcher_iz_score` likewise** — listed as bucketA outputs but bucketA did NOT fill
   them. Either they have a different producer or a precondition is unmet. **Find the producer before Phase F**, since
   these feed pitcher-side conference context.

# 🔍 C28 LOOSE ENDS — INVESTIGATED AND RESOLVED (2026-08-30)
Method: compare PROD against STAGING (which had already run C28) rather than reasoning from prod alone. This settled
all three in minutes — **always diff the two environments before theorising.**

## 1. ✅ `OPS`/`SLG`/`slg_plus` = 29/30 — EXPECTED, NOT A DEFECT. The missing conference is **Independent**.
```
PROD    — D1 conferences with NULL OPS: Independent
STAGING — D1 conferences with NULL OPS: Independent   (identical)
```
Independents have no conference-mates, so the conference hitting aggregate has nothing to pool. **29/30 is CORRECT on
both environments** — do NOT "fix" this. (Consistent with the existing rule that Independents are handled by
faced-competition Stuff+/HTP rather than conference pooling.)

## 2. ✅ `pitcher_ev_score` / `pitcher_iz_score` = 0/30 — NOT deprecated, NOT a prod gap. **Their producer has never run.**
Empty on **BOTH** prod and staging, so it is not something C28 broke. ⚠ I nearly recorded them as dead columns
superseded by `pitcher_ev90_score` / `pitcher_iz_whiff_score` — **that was WRONG.**
**They have a real producer: `src/savant/lib/conferenceScoutingAverages.ts`**, which WRITES them at `:453` / `:455`
(`pitcher_ev_score: round1(psEV)`, `pitcher_iz_score: round1(psIZ)`) and reads them back at `:520-522`.
→ **ACTION: run `conferenceScoutingAverages` for 2026 to fill them.** It has never been run for this season on either
environment. Pitcher EV mirrors hitter EV and is expected to be populated.

## 3. ★ PROD IS NOW AHEAD OF STAGING on the raw conference pitcher metrics
| column | PROD | STAGING |
|---|---|---|
| `pitcher_ev90` | **30/30** | 0/30 |
| `pitcher_exit_velo` | **30/30** | 0/30 |
| `pitcher_in_zone_pct` | **30/30** | 0/30 |
| `pitcher_iz_whiff_pct` | **30/30** | 0/30 |
| `pitcher_ev90_score` · `pitcher_iz_whiff_score` | 30/30 | 30/30 |
The C28 run filled these on prod; staging never had them. **CONSEQUENCE: staging is no longer a valid reference for
these columns** — do not treat a prod/staging mismatch here as a prod defect. Staging needs C24/C26/C27/C29 + this C28
pass applied to catch up (it only ever received the Stuff+ chain and the Conference Stuff+ lane fix).

## 🧠 LESSON
Two of the three "problems" were not problems, and the third was nearly mis-diagnosed in the opposite direction
(calling a live-but-unrun column deprecated). **Diff the environments FIRST, then grep for a producer, and only then
conclude.** A column being empty means one of: (a) expected/no data to pool, (b) its producer has not run, or
(c) genuinely dead — and those are indistinguishable from the fill count alone.
