/**
 * Class transition derivation.
 *
 * `players.class_year` is the canonical input (TruMedia / roster import sets
 * this per player). The projection engine reads `class_transition` on each
 * prediction row to apply year-over-year development adjustments
 * (FS=freshman→sophomore, SJ=sophomore→junior, JS=junior→senior, GR=grad).
 *
 * Historically a number of write-time call sites hardcoded "SJ" as the
 * default class_transition for new prediction / target rows. With accurate
 * class data from TruMedia, that default is wrong for every freshman, junior,
 * senior, and grad. This helper centralizes the derivation so every
 * write-time site can do the right thing without re-implementing the
 * normalization rules.
 *
 * Coaches can still manually override class_transition on the player profile
 * page when they need to model a non-standard development trajectory (e.g. a
 * redshirt, a JUCO transfer with unusual eligibility). The override sets
 * `class_transition_overridden = true` and locks the row from auto-infer.
